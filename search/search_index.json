The lexer does not work on the input directly, and the parser does not even see the characters . This is important to remember in case you need to do something advanced like manipulating the input. In this case the input is a string, but, of course, it could be any stream of content. The line 22 is redundant, since the option already defaults to true, but it shows that you can enable or disable it. Then, on line 23, we set the root node of the tree as a chat rule. You want to invoke the parser specifying a rule, which typically is the first rule. However, you can actually invoke any rule directly, like color . Once we get the parse tree from the parser, typically we want to process it using a listener or a visitor. In this case we specify a listener. Our particular listener takes a parameter: the response object. We want to use it to put some text in the response to send to the user. After setting the listener up, we finally walk the tree with our listener.","title":"Notes 1"},{"location":"ANTLR4/VSCODE%20Extension%20readme/","text":"Welcome to your VS Code Extension \u00b6 What's in the folder \u00b6 This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension. package.json - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension. syntaxes/nome.tmLanguage.json - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization. language-configuration.json - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

Classic wave pattern -> Send particles through two holes, -> Waves - you get high point low point etc If you look, then the particle pattern is formed but if you don't look, the wave pattern is observed Wheeler's delayed choice -> The electrons can make the choice even after the electron passes through the slit. How does quantum mechanics actually work Both properties cannot be measured. If you treat it as a wave(measure momentum), then you don't know its position Normal matter also behaves both as a partile and as a wave \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv} \\rightarrow = \\frac{h}{p}\\) This is the wavelength of the waveparticle duality of a mass. Photons has no rest mass, but energy is \\(E=hf\\) They msut always travel at c h = Plank's constant = \\(6.63\\times 10^{-34}Js\\) Photons of higher energy have higher frequency(f) and shorter wavelength (theta) wavelenghth is inversely related to frequency Think about this... A photon of ultraviolet light has much more energy than radio-wave photon. Hence when traveling through a vaccum, the ultraviolet light travels a the same speed as the radio-wave photon Stars - Huge, opaque, luminous balls of gas held together by gravity. About 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy Stars emit very hot inner parts, emit continuous radiation (\"continuum\") cooler outer layers absorb certain wavelength => Derive chemical composition Trillions of species on Earth Stars produced nearly everything in the universe. 10^-10m is the atom's radius. 10^-15 is the nucleus's radius. Electrons cannot absorb part of the photon's energy. It is all or nothing. So therefore, the photons can't absorb 2 photons that add up to the energy of a single photon. * technically, in extremely rare circumstances, 2 photons can be absorbed by a single electron. Ephoton = delta E = E4-E2 = hfphoton = hc/lambda(photon) (difference in energy levels) Emission of a photon Emission of photon (excess energy) occurs if electron jumps down to a lower energy level -> Emission occurs in any direcction(random). -> Several jumps can occur to various levels. Imaginary element Sunserium has three energy levels: E=0, E=2, and E=6. Transition from the lowest energy level to the middle energy level requires a photon from 600nm,, the wavelength of the photon absorbed in the transition form the middle energy level to the highest energy level In addition to the continuum, you will have a deficit of green photons, because a majority would have been absorbed. The reemission will replenish the originally absorbed photons because - Reemission will be directed at a random direction - Reemission may be separate, go through different energy levles, and thereby not reemit the original green photon Emission spectrum: the spectrum tthat shows all the emission of light from atomic radii, arranged by wavelength Ionization -> photon has enough energy to leave the atom. - Photon is absorbed - Electron is freed from a bound atom Don't need a specific delta E to ionize an atom, as long as the photon's E is greater than the atomic binding energy of the atom Recombination - electron is captured - photons are emitted as electron falls to a lower level. Ionised, as long as photon energy is greater than the ionization energy Recapture, recombination -> Can emit any combination of photons. Each neutral element and ionized element(i.e., one that lost >=1 electron) produces a unique patter of lines (like a fingerprint) Can identify the elements in the Universe! (Example: hydrogen atom H) Trained spectroscopist - that is how they can tell what stars are made of Its the patterns of the high-resolution spectrum that are important.

Call expressions in Scheme work exactly like they do in Python. To evaluate them: Evaluate the operator to get a procedure. Evaluate each of the operands from left to right. Apply the value of the operator to the evaluated operands. For example, consider the call expression (+ 1 2) . First, we evaluate the symbol + to get the built-in addition procedure. Then we evaluate the two operands 1 and 2 to get their corresponding atomic values. Finally, we apply the addition procedure to the values 1 and 2 to get the return value 3 . Operators may be symbols, such as + and * , or more complex expressions, as long as they evaluate to procedure values. Here is a reference for the Scheme Built-In Procedures . scm> (- 1 1) ; 1 - 1 0 scm> (* (+ 1 2) (+ 1 2)) ; (1 + 2) * (1 + 2) 9 Special Forms \u00b6 Special form expressions contain a special form as the operator. Special form expressions do not follow the same rules of evaluation as call expressions. Each special form has its own rules of evaluation -- that's what makes them special! Here's the Scheme Specification to reference the special forms we will cover in this class. It is important to note that everything in Scheme is either an atomic or an expression , so although these special forms look and operate similarly to Python, they are evaluated differently. Special forms like if , cond , and , or in Python direct the control flow of a program and allow you to evaluate specific expressions under some condition. In Scheme, however, these special forms are expressions that take in a set amount of parameters and return some value based on the condition passed in. If Expression An if expression looks like this: (if <predicate> <if-true> [if-false]) <predicate> and <if-true> are required expressions and [if-false] is optional. The rules for evaluation are as follows: Evaluate <predicate> . If <predicate> evaluates to a truth-y value, evaluate <if-true> and return its value. Otherwise, evaluate [if-false] if provided and return its value. if is a special form as not all of its operands will be evaluated. The value of the first operand determines whether the second or the third operator is evaluated. Boolean operators Like Python, Scheme has the boolean operators and , or , and not . and and or are special forms because they are short-circuiting operators, while not is a builtin procedure. and takes in any amount of operands and evaluates these operands from left to right until one evaluates to a false-y value. It returns that first false-y value or the value of the last expression if there are no false-y values. or also evaluates any number of operands from left to right until one evaluates to a truth-y value. It returns that first truth-y value or the value of the last expression if there are no truth-y values. not takes in a single operand, evaluates it, and returns its opposite truthiness value. All Scheme procedures are constructed as lambda procedures. One way to create a procedure is to use the lambda special form. (lambda (<param1> <param2> ...) <body>) This expression creates a lambda function with the given parameters and body, but does not evaluate the body. As in Python, the body is not evaluated until the function is called and applied to some argument values. The fact that neither the parameters nor the body is evaluated is what makes lambda a special form. We can also assign the value of an expression to a name with a define special form: (define (<name> <param> ...) <body> ...) (define <name> (lambda (<param> ...) <body> ...)) These two expressions are equivalent; the first is a concise version of the second. scm> ; Bind lambda function to square scm> (define square (lambda (x) (* x x))) square scm> (define (square x) (* x x)) ; Same as above square scm> square (lambda (x) (* x x)) scm> (square 4) 16 if Expressions \u00b6 The if special form allows us to evaluate one of two expressions based on a predicate. It takes in two required arguments and an optional third argument: (if <predicate> <if-true> [if-false]) The first operand is what's known as a predicate expression in Scheme, an expression whose value is interpreted as either #t or #f . The rules for evaluating an if special form expression are as follows: Evaluate <predicate> . If <predicate> evaluates to a truth-y value, evaluate and return the value if the expression <if-true> . Otherwise, evaluate and return the value of [if-false] if it is provided. Can you see why this expression is a special form? Compare the rules between a regular call expression and an if expression. What is the difference? Step 2 of evaluating call expressions requires evaluating all of the operands in order. However, an if expression will only evaluate two of its operands, the conditional expression and either <true-result> or <false-result> . Because we don't evaluate all the operands in an if expression, it is a special form. Let's compare a Scheme if expression with a Python if statement: Scheme Python scm> (if (> x 3) 1 2) >>> if x > 3: ... 1 ... else: ... 2 Although the code may look the same, what happens when each block of code is evaluated is actually very different. Specifically, the Scheme expression, given that it is an expression, evaluates to some value. However, the Python if statement simply directs the flow of the program. Another difference between the two is that it's possible to add more lines of code into the suites of the Python if statement, while a Scheme if expression expects just a single expression for each of the true result and the false result. One final difference is that in Scheme, you cannot write elif cases. If you want to have multiple cases using the if expression, you would need multiple branched if expressions: cond Expressions \u00b6 Using nested if expressions doesn't seem like a very practical way to take care of multiple cases. Instead, we can use the cond special form, a general conditional expression similar to a multi-clause if/elif/else conditional expression in Python. cond takes in an arbitrary number of arguments known as clauses . A clause is written as a list containing two expressions: (<p> <e>) . (cond (<p1> <e1>) (<p2> <e2>) ... (<pn> <en>) [(else <else-expression>)]) The first expression in each clause is a predicate. The second expression in the clause is the return expression corresponding to its predicate. The optional else clause has no predicate. The rules of evaluation are as follows: Evaluate the predicates <p1> , <p2> , ..., <pn> in order until you reach one that evaluates to a truth-y value. If you reach a predicate that evaluates to a truth-y value, evaluate and return the corresponding expression in the clause. If none of the predicates are truth-y and there is an else clause, evaluate and return <else-expression> . As you can see, cond is a special form because it does not evaluate its operands in their entirety; the predicates are evaluated separately from their corresponding return expression. In addition, the expression short circuits upon reaching the first predicate that evaluates to a truth-y value, leaving the remaining predicates unevaluated. The following code is roughly equivalent (see the explanation in the if expression section ): Scheme Python scm> (cond ((> x 0) 'positive) ((< x 0) 'negative) (else 'zero)) >>> if x > 0: ... 'positive' ... elif x < 0: ... 'negative' ... else: ... 'zero'","title":"Cs disc 1102"},{"location":"CS61A/disc/cs_disc_1102/#special-forms","text":"Special form expressions contain a special form as the operator. Special form expressions do not follow the same rules of evaluation as call expressions. Each special form has its own rules of evaluation -- that's what makes them special! Here's the Scheme Specification to reference the special forms we will cover in this class. It is important to note that everything in Scheme is either an atomic or an expression , so although these special forms look and operate similarly to Python, they are evaluated differently. Special forms like if , cond , and , or in Python direct the control flow of a program and allow you to evaluate specific expressions under some condition. In Scheme, however, these special forms are expressions that take in a set amount of parameters and return some value based on the condition passed in. If Expression An if expression looks like this: (if <predicate> <if-true> [if-false]) <predicate> and <if-true> are required expressions and [if-false] is optional. The rules for evaluation are as follows: Evaluate <predicate> . If <predicate> evaluates to a truth-y value, evaluate <if-true> and return its value. Otherwise, evaluate [if-false] if provided and return its value. if is a special form as not all of its operands will be evaluated. The value of the first operand determines whether the second or the third operator is evaluated. Boolean operators Like Python, Scheme has the boolean operators and , or , and not . and and or are special forms because they are short-circuiting operators, while not is a builtin procedure. and takes in any amount of operands and evaluates these operands from left to right until one evaluates to a false-y value. It returns that first false-y value or the value of the last expression if there are no false-y values. or also evaluates any number of operands from left to right until one evaluates to a truth-y value. It returns that first truth-y value or the value of the last expression if there are no truth-y values. not takes in a single operand, evaluates it, and returns its opposite truthiness value. All Scheme procedures are constructed as lambda procedures. One way to create a procedure is to use the lambda special form. (lambda (<param1> <param2> ...) <body>) This expression creates a lambda function with the given parameters and body, but does not evaluate the body. As in Python, the body is not evaluated until the function is called and applied to some argument values. The fact that neither the parameters nor the body is evaluated is what makes lambda a special form. We can also assign the value of an expression to a name with a define special form: (define (<name> <param> ...) <body> ...) (define <name> (lambda (<param> ...) <body> ...)) These two expressions are equivalent; the first is a concise version of the second. scm> ; Bind lambda function to square scm> (define square (lambda (x) (* x x))) square scm> (define (square x) (* x x)) ; Same as above square scm> square (lambda (x) (* x x)) scm> (square 4) 16","title":"Special Forms"},{"location":"CS61A/disc/cs_disc_1102/#if-expressions","text":"The if special form allows us to evaluate one of two expressions based on a predicate. It takes in two required arguments and an optional third argument: (if <predicate> <if-true> [if-false]) The first operand is what's known as a predicate expression in Scheme, an expression whose value is interpreted as either #t or #f . The rules for evaluating an if special form expression are as follows: Evaluate <predicate> . If <predicate> evaluates to a truth-y value, evaluate and return the value if the expression <if-true> . Otherwise, evaluate and return the value of [if-false] if it is provided. Can you see why this expression is a special form? Compare the rules between a regular call expression and an if expression. What is the difference? Step 2 of evaluating call expressions requires evaluating all of the operands in order. However, an if expression will only evaluate two of its operands, the conditional expression and either <true-result> or <false-result> . Because we don't evaluate all the operands in an if expression, it is a special form.

Terminology: Python Object System - Functions are objects. - Bound methods are also objects: a function that has its first parameter \"self\" already bound to an instance (of the class) - Dot expressions evalate to bound methods for class attributes that are functions. - Example: - instance.method_name Looking up attributes by name(reminder) expression . name To evaluate dot expression 1. Evaluate expression to the left of the dot, which yields the object(required) 2. Name is matched against the instance attributes of that object; if an attribute with that name exists, its vlaue is returned. 3. If not, name is looked up in the class, which yields a class attribute value 4. That value is returned unless its a function, in which case a bound method is returned instaed Assignment statements with a dot expression on their left-hand side affect attirbutes for the objet of that dot expression. - If the object is instance , then assignemnt set sinstance attribute - If object is class , then assignment sets a class attribute. Instance attribute assignment example: 'interest' is an instance attribute, since the object of the dot expression(the first thing before the dot) is tom_account , which is an instance (of class Account) The name ( interest ) is not looked up in the class. In fact, tom_account didn't even have an attribute interest , only holder and balance , since it wasn't defined in the constructor. So basically python creates a new attribute called interest under tom_account . Class attribute Assignment Account exists and is a class, so this is class attirbute assignment. Since the interest attribute already exists, that attribute under Account will be modified. Attribute Assignment Statements For class assignemnt So interest is the attribute for every class. (withdraw, deposit) are methods. As seen above, we see that the interest attribute is not static and can be changed, and thsi change will be reflected in all of the instances of the class Account For instance assignemnt - Instance assignment attributes in different objects are different and can take on different values, even if both instances involved are objects of the same class - The instance assignment (name) can be the same as a class attribute, and that will be completely fine. The assignment of the attribute for the instance is independent from the class attribute. Inheritance Inheritance -> Relating classes together Common use: Two similar classes differ in degree of specialization. 1) Specialized class may have same attributes as general class, along with special-case behaviour 2) New subclass \"shares\" attr with base class 3) Subclass may override inherited attributes, class or instance. Example Inheritance Checking account -> specialized Account (with interest cuz banks are trash) 1) Basically regular account, but withdraw method is stlightly different. 2) Perfect solution is to have the Checking account extend/inherit from Account, but overriding the withdraw method to add the fee which is why banks are trash Extending in python example below: Base class attributes aren't copied into subclasses!

Try Statements \u00b6 Try statements handles exceptions: try: <try suite> except <exception class> as name: <except suite> Handling Exceptions >>> try: x = 1/0 except ZeroDivisionError as e: x = 0 Scheme is a programming language that has few rules. Programming Languages \u00b6 A computer typically executes program written in many different programming langauges Machine Languages: statements are interpreted by the hardware itself - A fixed set of instructions invoke operations implemented by the circuitry of the central processing unit(CPU) - Operations refer to specific hardware memoray addresses; no abstraction mechanisms Higher level languages statements & expressions are interpreted by another program or compiled (translated) into another language. - Provide means of abstraction such as naming, ufnction defintion, and objects. - Abstract away system details to be independent of hardware or operating systems Metalinguistic Abstraction \u00b6 A powerful form of abstraction is to define a new language that is tailored to a particular type of application or problem domain. Type of application: Erlang was designed for concurrent programs. It ahs built-in elements for expressing concurrent communication. It is used, for example, to implement chat servers with many simulatenous connections. Problem Domain The MediaWiki markup language was designed for generating static web pages. It ahs built-in elemnets for text formatting and cross-page linking. it is uesed, for example, to create Wikipedia pages. A programming language has: - Syntax : the legal statements and expressions in the lagnauge - Semantics : The execution/evaluation rule for those statemnets and expressions To create a new programming langauge, you either need a: - Specification : A document decribin the precise syntax and semantics of the language - Canonical Implementation : An interpreter or complier for the language. Part 3: Special Forms \u00b6 This section will be completed in scheme_forms.py . Logical special forms include if , and , or , and cond . These expressions are special because not all of their sub-expressions may be evaluated. In Scheme, only #f is a false value. All other values (including 0 and nil ) are true values. You can test whether a value is a true or false value using the provided Python functions is_scheme_true and is_scheme_false , defined in scheme_utils.py . Scheme traditionally uses #f to indicate the false Boolean value. In our interpreter, that is equivalent to false or False . Similarly, true , True , and #t are all equivalent. However, when unlocking tests , use #t and #f . To get you started, we've provided an implementation of the if special form in the do_if_form function. Make sure you understand that implementation before starting the following questions. The Structure of an Interpreter \u00b6 It shares a lot with calculator example There is an Eval and an Apply function. Eval \u00b6 Base cases: - Primitive values (numbers) - Look up values bound to symbols Recursive calls: - Eval(operator, operands) of call expressions - Apply(procedure, arguments) - Eval(sub-expressions) of special forms This is going to require an environment for symbol lookup. Apply \u00b6 Base cases; - Built-in primitive procedures Recursive calls: - Eval(body) of user defined procedures Creates a new environment each time a user-defined procedure(like a lambda function) is applied Scheme Evaluation \u00b6 The scheme_eval function dispatches on expression for form: - Symbols are bound to valeus in the current environment - Self-evaluating expressions are returned - All other legal expressions are represented as Scheme lists, called combinations. (if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>) (lambda (<formal-parameters>) <body>) (define <name> <expression>) (<operator> <operand 0> ... <operand k>) (define (demo s) (if (null? s) '(3) ) Logical Special Forms \u00b6 Logical forms may only evaluate some sub-expressions. - If expression: if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative> - And and or : ( and <e1> ... <en> ) ( or <e1> ... <en> ) - Cond expression: ( cond (<p1> <e1>) ... (<pn> <en>) ) The value of an if expression is the value of a sub-expression. - Evaluate the predicate - Choose a sub-expression: <consequent> or <alternative> - Evaluate that sub-expression in place of the whole expression. Quotation \u00b6 The quote special form evaluates to the quoted expression, which is not evaluated The <expresssion> itself is the value of the expression '<expression> is shorthand for ( quote <expression> ) Define Expressions \u00b6 Define binds a symbol to a value in the first frame of the current environment: (define <name> <expression>) We define the following procedural steps 1. Evaluate the <expression> 2. Bind <name> to its value in the current frame. Procedure definition: - Shorthand of define with a lambda expression (define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>) This above is equivalent to: (define <name> (lambda (<formal parameters>) <body>)) Applying User-defined procedures \u00b6 To apply user-defined procedure, we must create a new frame bound to argument values, whose parent is the env of the procedure. Evaluate the body of the procedure in the environemnt that starts with this new frame.

To do this, the interpreter needs to understand how the rules of a language work, and to do that, the interpreter needs to be designed (by a human, usually!) to follow those rules. In CS 61A, we'd like to learn how the interpreter program works and understand the ideas that go into an interpreter to reveal the magic behind how a computer makes sense of (+ 1 2) in Scheme and 1 + 2 in Python. REPL \u00b6 The interpreters we study in this course are designed around a Read-Eval-Print-Loop . The interpreter waits for our input, looping until we type in a string of characters, (+ 1 2) . In the Read stage, we take the string of characters and convert those characters into data structures that can be understood by the interpreter. In the Scheme interpreter, we'd like to take the string of characters (+ 1 2) and convert it into a Pair structure, Pair('+', Pair(1, Pair(2, nil))) . The Lexer takes the string (+ 1 2) and splits into meaningful tokens wherever there is whitespace or a syntax character like the open parenthesis ( . The lexer returns a structure that kind of resembles a list of individual characters like ['(', '+', 1, 2, ')'] . The Parser takes the list of smaller strings and converts them into a data structure that understands the nesting in the language. It's not too tricky to convert the example above from ['(', '+', '1', '2', ')'] to Pair('+', Pair(1, Pair(2, nil))) . But the pair structure is much more useful when we want to work on a more nested example like (= (+ 1 2) 3) which the lexer converts into the flat list ['(', '=', '(', '+', 1, 2, ')', 3, ')'] . As the expressions get more and more complicated, using a nested data structure helps the computer make sense of the expression in chunks, much like how we humans make sense of a Scheme expression as well. In the Eval stage, we evaluate the nested data structure to a value. If the expression is simple, like a number or a boolean, we can just return the number or boolean itself without any further evaluation. Evaluating 1 in the global frame returns the number 1 . If we pass in a name like 'x', we'll try to evaluate the name 'x' in the current environment, looking up through the parent frames as necessary. If we pass a call expression like Pair('+', Pair(1, Pair(2, nil))) into the evaluator, we'll follow the call expression evaluation rules to determine the value of the value of the expression. We'll evaluate the operator, '+' , to the built-in procedure which adds values, and each operand, 1 and 2, before applying the procedure to the arguments. if the expression is a special form like Pair('define', Pair('x', Pair(1, nil))) (after parsing (define x 1) ), then we'll follow the special form evaluation rules defined in the Scheme interpreter. In this example, we don't need to evaluate the name 'x' (it's just a name!) but we do need to evaluate the value, the number 1 . In the Print stage, we take the value we determined in the evaluation stage and figure out how to display the value to the user. Even if an expression evaluates to a number, the computer actually stores that number in its memory as a bunch of 0 and 1 binary digits! We take that number and convert it back to a more readable representation like '3'! Once we've displayed the value, we can wait in a Loop until the user asks another question to the interpreter.

Usually, the quote special form tells us to not evaluate whatever is immeidately after the quote. However, the quasiquote form is slightly different, it allows both quoting and unquoting The quasiquote allows us to construct literal lists in a similar way as a quote, but also lets us specify if any subexpression within the list should be evaluated. Consider that we rewrite the twice macro as follows: (define-macro (twice f) '(begin f f)) This seems like it would have the same effect, but since the quote form prevents any evalaution, the result expression that is being created would actually be (begin f f) , which is not what is being wanted. The quasiquote allows us to construct literal lists in a similar way as a quote, but also lets us specify if any expression within the list should be evaluated. At first glance, the quasiquote (which can be invoked with the backtick or the quasiquote special form) behaves exactly the same as ' or quote . However, using quasiquotes gives you the ability to unquote (which can be invoked with a comma , or the unquote special form). THis removes an expression from the quoted context, evaluates it and places it back in. By combining quasiquotes and unquoting, we can oten save ourselves a lot of trouble when building macro expressions. Quasiquotes use thie backtick symbol Whilst regular quotes are just '' these. Quasiquotes unquoting is basically the , mark, where we can have: Its like define-macro allows an unknown(unevaluated) scheme expression to be passed in as the parameter. Then, the define macro can be used to combine these expressions to form a bigger expression, which is then going to be evaluated. define-macro allows us to define what's known as a macro which is just a simpler way for us to combine unknown expressions together into another expression. When we call macro, the operands of the expression are not evaluated but are instead treated as Scheme data. This means any operands that are call expressions or special form expressions are treated as lists. Regular lambda procedure: - Evaluate operator - Evaluate operands - Apply operator to operands, evaluating the bod of the procedure.

It is important to note that everything in Scheme is either an atomic or an expression , so although these special forms look and operate similarly to Python, they are evaluated differently. Special forms like if , cond , and , or in Python direct the control flow of a program and allow you to evaluate specific expressions under some condition. In Scheme, however, these special forms are expressions that take in a set amount of parameters and return some value based on the condition passed in. Built-in Procedures \u00b6 To be able to call built-in procedures, such as + , you need to complete the BuiltinProcedure case within the scheme_apply function in scheme_eval_apply.py . Built-in procedures are applied by calling a corresponding Python function that implements the procedure.

In computer science, trees are recursive data structures that are widely used in various settings and can be implemented in many ways. The diagram below is an example of a tree. Notice that the tree branches downward. In computer science, the root of a tree starts at the top, and the leaves are at the bottom. Some terminology regarding trees: Parent Node : A node that has at least one branch. Child Node : A node that has a parent. A child node can only have one parent. Root : The top node of the tree. In our example, this is the 1 node. Label : The value at a node. In our example, every node's label is an integer. Leaf : A node that has no branches. In our example, the 4 , 5 , 6 , 2 nodes are leaves. Branch : A subtree of the root. Trees have branches, which are trees themselves: this is why trees are recursive data structures. Depth : How far away a node is from the root. We define this as the number of edges between the root to the node. As there are no edges between the root and itself, the root has depth 0. In our example, the 3 node has depth 1 and the 4 node has depth 2. Height : The depth of the lowest (furthest from the root) leaf.

There is a unique such set, called the empty set, denoted by the symbol \\(\\emptyset\\) . A set can also have an infinite number of elements, such as the set of all integers, prime numbers, or odd numbers. Subsets and Proper Subsets If every element of a set A is also in set B, then we say that A is a subset of B, written A \u2286 B. We can also write B \u2287 A, or B is a superset of A. A proper subset is a set A that is strictly contained in B, written as A \u2282 B, meaning that A excludes at least one element of B. For example, consider the set B = {1,2,3,4,5}. Then {1,2,3} is both a subset and a proper subset of B, while {1,2,3,4,5} is a subset but not a proper subset of B. Here are a few basic properties regarding subsets 1) Two sets are said to be disjoint if A\u2229B = \\(\\emptyset\\) 2) The union of a set A with a set B, written as A\u222aB, is the set of all elements which are in either A or B or both.

Why is the norm important? The norm of a vector is also the magnitude of the vector (or length of the arrow). This corresponds to the usual notion of distance in \\(R^2\\) or \\(R^3\\) .

In this section, we\u2019ll assume that we\u2019ve already determined the distance from the receiver to each beacon (we\u2019ll explain how to measure this distance in the next section). Let\u2019s imagine we have a situation like the one below. We know the locations of the beacons \\(\\vec{a_1},\\vec{a_2},\\vec{a_3}\\) , but don\u2019t know the location of the point at \\(\\vec{x}\\) (we\u2019ll be trying to find out what \\(\\vec{x}\\) is).

We call a signal a discrete-time signal if it is only defined at specific points in time (for example, every minute). In contrast, a continuous-time signal is defined over all time. In this class we\u2019ll focus on discrete-time signals. We can represent a discrete-time signal as a list of numbers.

Consider the following example: a beacon in our GPS system is sending a message using radio waves. The amplitude of the radio wave as a function of time is a signal, and we only consider discrete times (for example, every second). We can represent the signal graphically or as a vector: Every element of the vector represents the signal value at one timestep.

Why is the norm important? The norm of a vector is also the magnitude of the vector (or length of the arrow). This corresponds to the usual notion of distance in \\(R^2\\) or \\(R^3\\) . It is interesting to note that the set of points with equal Euclidean norm is a circle in \\(R^2\\) or a sphere in \\(R^3\\) . More generally, any choice of inner product(assuming the more general version) will give rise to a corresponding norm via defining \\(||v|| := <\\vec{v},\\vec{v}>\\) . Although they can be very useful, these norms will not generally correspond to the Euclidean length that we are all familiar with. The following properties are true for all norms (not just the 2-norm). Non-negativity: For \\(\\vec{x} \\in R^n\\) , \\(||x|| \u2265 0\\) Now that we have defined the inner product, it\u2019s time to get an intuition about what an inner product is.

Find all distances from receiver to various beacons(satelites), based on messages received 2. Combine distance measurements to calculate the absolute distance, i.e. the absolute location of the receiver.

Inks can be made from metallic nanoparticles and deposited using inkjet printing, screen printing, and spray coating. A commonly printed metal ink is silver. Note 15 \u00b6 Circuit analysis can be cumbersome to do by hand, and it can be difficult to understand the high-level behavior of complicated circuits given a schematic. We need tools we can use to both lessen the burden of analysis, and help us think about circuits and understand how they behave. Ultimately, our goal is to design interesting circuits, and in this note we will build up additional tools to help us. Dependent Sources \u00b6 At this point, we will introduce a new circuit element: dependent sources. Dependent sources act like the independent sources we\u2019ve studied so far, but instead of a producing a single voltage/current, the voltage/current is controlled by something else in the circuit. There are four different types of dependent sources, shown below. I.e. Dependent source (provides voltage, current depending on another quantity of voltage/current that is being provided) In this case, the current in the dependent source is equal a constant (gm) times the voltage vc, which is defined elsewhere in the circuit. Just like an independent current source, this dependent source will produce the same current, regardless of what is connected to it (unless vc changes \u2013 then the current will change appropriately). As we\u2019ll see in future notes, dependent sources are useful tools for modeling many advanced circuit elements. For each independent source k (either voltage source or current source): - Set all other independent sources to 0 - Voltage source: replace with a wire - Current source: replace with an open circuit - Compute the circuit voltages and currents due to this source k - Compute Vout by summing the Vout,ks for all k We know that the slope of the line is equal to 1/R . What happens in the limit where R trends towards infinity? Then the line becomes the x-axis, which corresponds to an open circuit as we\u2019ve seen earlier. Now what happens in the limit where R trends towards zero? The line becomes the y-axis, which corresponds to a wire. To summarize, zero voltage source and zero resistance are equivalent to wires (i.e. short circuits); zero current source and infinite resistance are equivalent to open circuits. Definition of equivalence Two circuits are equivalent if they have the same I \u2212V relationship. (An example of an I \u2212V is that of a resistor, i.e., V = IR or I = V R ). This is exactly what we mean by equivalence; be careful not to overextend this definition or apply others. For example, equivalence tells us nothing about the power in a circuit and one should be careful not to assume it does. Now why is this possibly intuitively? Since voltage and current are governed by a linear relationship for all of the circuit elements we\u2019ve learned about, and a line can be uniquely determined by exactly two points, we can capture the original circuit with a simplified circuit that has exactly two components: a voltage (or current) source and a resistor. Definition 15.1 (equivalent circuit): If we pick two terminals within a circuit, we say that another circuit is equivalent to the original circuit if it exhibits the same I \u2212V relationship at those two terminals. 15.8 Summary for Finding Equivalent Resistance In general, there are three ways of finding the Thevenin/Norton equivalent resistance of a circuit. However, some of them only work in certain situations, so need to be used with caution. 1. Zero out all independent sources and apply a Vtest or Itest to calculate the resulting Itest or Vtest respectively. Req = Vtest / Itest . This is the method that we described in detail in the examples above, because this method works for any circuit. When in doubt, this method is the most reliable. 2. Zero out all independent sources and reduce the entire remaining circuit into a single resistor using the series and parallel resistor formulas that were derived in Sections 15.7.1 and 15.7.2. This method does not work if there are dependent sources. Remember that only independent sources are zeroed out, and there are no resistor formulas for dependent sources. In addition, some resistor configurations cannot be decomposed into combinations of parallel and series resistances. 3. Calculate Vth and Ino, Req = Vth / Ino . This is an efficient method of finding Req if both the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are being derived. Why does this work? Since the IV relationship is linear, we can calculate the slope (which is the reciprocal of resistance) from any two points. Vth and Ino are the points where the IV curve crosses the V and I axes, respectively (see the left-hand figure below). However, this method does not work if Vth and Ino do not provide two unique points on the IV curve (see the right-hand figure below). Specifically, this method only works if there is at least one independent source in the circuit. When there are no independent sources, Vth = Ino = 0 which does not provide enough information to calculate Req.","title":"EECS circuits"},{"location":"EECS16A/EECS_circuits/#power","text":"What does it mean for the power of a particular component to be negative, for the following components?

Therefore the change of basis is given by: \\(~u_a = A^{\u22121} ~u\\)","title":"Eecs change basis"},{"location":"EECS16A/eecs_column_space/","text":"Column space : range of operator = space of all outputs that the operator can map itself to \\(Col(A) = \\{ \\vec{v} | \\vec{v} = \\sum x_i\\times a_i\\}\\) Think of linear matrix of \\(dim = N*M\\) as linear function taking in vector of dimensionality m and outputting a vector of dimensionality n So we must have the range of linear matrix = the column space of linear matrix Dimensionality of matrix -> How many parameters required to define vectors in the column space of the matrix.

Eigenvectors cannot be zero vector \\(\\vec{0}\\) by default, because we see that the pair of eigenvectors//eigenvalues: \\( \\(\\lambda = 0, \\vec{v} = 0\\) \\) is the trivial pair for every possible matrix. So we usually do not like it. Eigenspace: If there are two eigenvectors, they form an eigenspace , which is the space of all vectors \\(~v\\) for which \\(A~v\\) = \\(\u03bb~v\\) Repeated Eigenvalues: For \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix, it is possible that two eigenvalues can end up with the same value. This phenomenon is known as the Repeated Eigenvalue This repeated eigenvalue can have either 1 or 2 associated vectors. Example: \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix}\\lambda && 0 \\\\ 0 && \\lambda \\end{bmatrix}\\) has a repeated eigenvalue of \\(\\lambda\\) The eigenspace of this matrix is all of \\(R^2\\) since for any vector \\(\\vec{v} \\in R^2, A\\vec{v} = \\lambda \\vec{v}\\) Since the above quadratic equation has real coefficients, we know that there are three possible cases to consider: 1. There are two, real, distinct eigenvalues \\(\u03bb_1\\) and \\(\u03bb_2\\) that satisfy the equation. 2. There is a single (repeated) eigenvalue of \u03bb that satisfies the equation. 3. There are two, complex, distinct eigenvalues \\(\u03bb_1\\) and \\(\u03bb_2\\) that satisfy the equation All eigenvectors with different eigenvalues are linearly independent! More formally, we claim: Theorem 9.2: Let \\(~v_1,~v_2,...,~v_m\\) be eigenvectors of an \\(n\u00d7n\\) matrix with distinct eigenvalues. It is the case that all the \\(~v_i\\) are linearly independent from one another General Initial States All we\u2019ve considered so far are steady states of the form \\(~x[0] = ~v\\) where \\(~v\\) is an eigenvector of the transformation matrix \\(A\\) . What if we have an arbitrary initial state, which in general may not be an eigenvector of \\(A\\) ? Assumption: Matrixes of eigenvector form a basis : spans all base spaces -> i.e. spans the entire column space \\(A\\) is \\(n\u00d7n\\) , then any initial state \\(~x[0]\\) can be written as a linear combination \\(~x[0] = \u03b1_1~v_1 +\u03b1_2~v_2 +...+\u03b1_n~v_n\\) We have: \\( \\(x[t] = A^t ~x[0]\\) \\) We solve for the equation: Solution: CRITERIA FOR CONVERGENCE: Cool Fact: Eigenvector of 3D rotation is axis of rotation! Why is this the case? Reason: The eigenvectors of a 3D rotation doesn't get knocked off its span, as it doesn't change after the (rotation matrix \\(R\\) ) is being applied. Problem: However, this eigenvector is only the eigenvector \\(v_1\\) that has eigenvalue \\(\\lambda>0\\) , since it can't really be flipped. If eigenvalue \\(\\lambda <0\\) , then the eigenvector \\(v_2\\) is the normal to the rotation axis I think. Under linear transformations like these, vetors typically get knocked off their span; however, some remain on their orignal span. -> These vectors, who are only scaled by the transformation and thus remain on their original span are called \"eigenvectors\" Eigenvalues and eigenvectors come in pairs. Solving for eigenvalues of matrix \\(A: det(A-\\lambda I) = 0\\) Solving for corresponding Eigenvectors: \\(\\vec{v} \\in Null(A-\\lambda I)\\) Let matrix \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix}a&&b\\\\c&&d\\end{bmatrix}\\) Characteristic polynomia of \\(A\\) : \\(ad-d\\lambda -a\\lambda +(\\lambda)^2 -bc=0\\) -> So at most 2 solutions for eigenvalues. So basically for first problem, we have: \\( \\(M=\\begin{bmatrix}1&&0\\\\0&&9\\end{bmatrix}, \\lambda = 1, 9\\) \\) We have: \\( \\(M-1(I) = \\begin{bmatrix}0 && 0 \\\\ 0 && 8\\end{bmatrix}\\) \\) Using augumented matrix vector form: \\( \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0 && 0 && 0 \\\\ 0 && 8 && 0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 && 0 && 0 \\\\ 0 && 1 && 0\\end{bmatrix}\\) \\) So we let solution be \\([x,y]\\) , we have \\(0\\cdot x = 0, y = 0\\) , so hence the span of eigenvectors = \\(\\alpha \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}\\) The steady-state frequency (i.e. fraction of visitors in steady-state) for a graph of websites is related to the eigenspace associated with eigenvalue 1 for the \u201ctransition matrix\u201d of the graph. Once computed, an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 will have values which correspond to the steady-state frequency for the fraction of people for each webpage. When the elements of this eigenvector are made to sum to one (to conserve population) , the i'th element of the eigenvector will correspond to the fraction of people on the i th website.","title":"Eecs eigenvalues"},{"location":"EECS16A/eecs_img2_prereading/","text":"Imaging 2: - Goals - Finding relationship between physical quantity (light intensity) - Measuring the physical quantity(light intensity) in order to scan an image","title":"Eecs img2 prereading"},{"location":"EECS16A/eecs_touch3b/","text":"\\(I_{in} = I_f = C \\frac{dV_C}{dt}\\) We see that, by properties of integration: \\(\\frac{dV_C}{dt} = \\frac{I_{in}}{C}\\) , \\(V_C = \\int \\frac{I_{in}(t)}{C} dt = \\int_{t_0}^t \\frac{I_{in}(t)}{C}dt + V(t_0)\\) Where \\(V(t_0)\\) is the total voltage at iniital time \\(t_0\\) .

Modeling of the Resistive Touch Screen Problem: to find the location of touch. - Go from mechanical to electrical quantity - Want to measure \\(\\frac{L_{touch}}{L}\\) - \\(L_{touch}\\) unknown - Total length = \\(L\\) , also \\(L_{touch}+L_{rest} = L\\) Connection made between the red surface and the black surface How to find \\(L_{touch}\\) ? - Big brain method: - Assume the red and black thingy (above) have fixed resistivity. Also assume that red and black ends have a fixed voltage drop. Then when the touch is activated, we have a closed circuit with resistance we can calculate w.r.t \\(L_{touch}\\) . So then we can figure out \\(L_{touch}\\) based on the resistivities and others. So we have equations: - (1) \\(R_1=p\\times \\frac{L_{rest}}{A}\\) , - (2) \\(R_2=p\\times \\frac{L_{touch}}{A}\\) , So,basically a touchscreen is kinda like a voltage divider \\(U_{mid} = \\frac{p\\cdot L_{touch}/A}{p\\cdot L_{touch}/A+p\\cdot L_{rest}/A}\\cdot V_s\\) So we have the expression: \\(U_{mid} = \\frac{L_{touch}}{L_{touch}+L_{rest}}V_s\\) \\(U_{mid} = \\frac{L_{touch}}{L}V_s\\) Now we have conducting plate(the black thingy). \\(el_1:\\) wire - The box \\(el_2,el_3:\\) open-circuit, the red bounded boxes on the left and right side \\(\\rightarrow\\) Model 1 - Add an ideal wire(assume 0 resistance) to represent bottom plate How to know where touch is happening given these constraints? Voltage Def: \\(el_2, V_{el2} = U_1 - 0\\) \\(el_1, V_{el1} = U_{mid} - U_1\\) So we see that: \\(U_{mid} = V_{el1}+V_{el2}\\) However, we can easily see that \\(V_{el1}=0\\) given that \\(V_{el1}\\) is across a wire. So, we have: \\(U_{mid} = V_{el2} = U_1\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) Conclusion - By measuring \\(U_1\\) or \\(V_{el2}\\) , we can get easily the voltage required for \\(U_{mid}\\) , and thereby solve for the position(L) of the touch position using the formula (1) Assume both top and bottom plates are imperfect Adding a resistor doesn't matter as there is no current flowing through anyway. So basically since its an open circuit, the voltage is the same across the resistors \\(R_4,R_3\\) and so basically the voltage is always \\(U_{mid}\\) A surprising circuit What are \\(u_2\\) and \\(u_3\\) ? We have, by the diagram above: \\(u_2 - 0 = \\frac{R_3}{R_1+R_3}\\cdot (u_1-0)\\) , since \\(V_s = u_1\\) \\(u_3 - 0 = \\frac{R_4}{R_2+R_4}\\cdot (u_1-0)\\) \\(u_1-0=V_s\\)","title":"Eecs lec 12"},{"location":"EECS16A/eecs_lecture/eecs_lec_13/","text":"Last Class A surprising circuit \\(u_2 = \\frac{R_3}{R_1+R_3} V_s\\) \\(u_3 = \\frac{R_4}{R_2+R_4} V_s\\) Now we assume that: \\(R_3 = kR_1\\) \\(R_4=kR_2\\) Power supply keeps U in wires equal to \\(V_s\\) regardless of how many branches we have! \\(u_2 = \\frac{kR_1}{R_1+kR_1}V_s\\) So therefore: \\(u_2=\\frac{k}{1+k}V_s\\) So therefore we also have: \\(u_2=u_3\\) We must have \\(V_{el5} = U_2-U_3\\) (Voltage Def) Bold Assumption \\(V_{el5} = 0\\) If \\(R_5\\) , the resistor between \\(V_{el5}\\) is zero(i.e.) the thingy is a wire, then we must have that the circuit would just take the path of least resistance. 2D Touch Screen So essentially, a 2D Touchscreen is made via two different materials. The screen is made of a high density material(i.e. poor conductor), whilst the bottom is low density material. Total length(L) \\(L = L_{touch} + L_{rest}\\) We must have that: \\(R = \\frac{\\rho L}{A}\\) \\(V_{out} = U_{mid}\\) So essentially there are two plates.

Equivalence Two circuits are equivalent if they have the same IV relationship If you connect a phone to a power source, then you can measure an IV curve. If you then connect that to a box (charging box), you can also measure an IV curve. If the two IV curves are the same, then the two circuits would be equivalent. Example : Wire and Voltage source that provides zero voltage is basically equivalent. Similarly, Current Source and open circuit(current source with zero current) are equivalent. As long as the IV relation is the same, circuits are equivalent! \\(V_{el} = V_s+V_r\\) \\(V_{el} = V_s+I_{el}R\\) \\(I_{el} = \\frac{1}{R}V_{el}-\\frac{V_s}{R}\\) Current going through the loop should be \\(I_{el}\\) .

Specifically, the author was part of a group that designed a mechanism through which Feeding America transitioned from a centralized allocation system , in which food banks (implicitly) queued for food, to a system in which they bid daily in auctions for truckloads of food using a \u201cfake\u201d currency that the nonprofit designed. Ways of allocating goods without an actual price/way to discriminate The first is to ask consumers to rank a set of possible outcomes . For example, a student lists which school she likes best, second best, and so on on\u2014or a budding medical resident ranks hospitals. Through appropriate choice of mechanism, the consumer finds it in her interest to report truthfully, and is then efficiently \u201cmatched\u201d to an outcome. The second way is to use a more standard market setting where goods have prices, but where participants can only use a specialized currency to buy the goods in the allocation system. Initial Method: Need is calculated via a customised metric, whereby food was given out to the banks based on a sort of \"wait your turn\" method. The food bank had 4\u20136 hours to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d After a food bank was offered food, its position in the queue would be recalculated, as its measure of food received relative to need would change. If it turned down the offer, the load would go to the next food bank in the queue. This mechanism had been used since the late 1980s, and it allocated 200\u2013220 million pounds of food each year from 2000 to 2004. Feeding America did not distinguish much between different kinds of food, so that each food bank on average got a similar product mix from them (though randomly a food bank could get lucky or unlucky in whether it would get food that was popular among participants). Problems: 1) Unaware of the needs of each food bank. Equal delivery of all food products to each food bank(which might have excess of certain product and shortage in otherse). 2) Food frequently spoils before deadline cuz foodbanks take too long to respond with the queuing system Solution:(bidding via fake currency(handed out to each foodbank based on percceived need)) - sealed bid(preventing snipe) - fractional bidding(smaller food banks can combine their bids (each contributing a fraction), and later arrange for splitting of the food items delivered) - Contracting out bidding to more experienced members - A concern was that some food banks\u2014again most likely the smaller ones\u2014would find bidding so intimidating that they would largely withdraw from the allocation process. This concern was alleviated by Feeding America giving the option to delegate bidding to an employee of Feeding America, where a food bank could simply outline in broad terms its needs to that person. Credit system(for smaller food banks with less need) They pay off those debts with at least half their future allocations of shares\u2014meaning the nightly redistribution of shares used on that day (described below)\u2014until debt is paid off Negative pricing So basically if a food item is incredibly undesirable, food banks can put nnegative pricing on the food item, so essentially if they are later forced to keep the food due to various reasons, the aformentioned food bank will get more (of the fake currency) that they can then use on more products. Feeding America also has pressure to give out food items it receives, cuz otherwise the donor will be pissed Overriding allocation rule, giving some food banks more or less fake currency depending on extenuating circumstances As one extreme example, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans soon after the redesign committee\u2019s deliberations. A less-extreme example might be the closure of a major local manufacturing plant GOAL FACTOR: Number of poor in a food bank\u2019s area compared to the national average. In the older queuing approach, Feeding America treated all pounds of food as equal. With the bidding system, some food banks have chosen to buy mainly large quantities of cheap food, while others buy smaller quantities of more expensive food. Moreover, some food-rich banks never spend all their shares, which benefits the food poor. Here we have the reallocation of demand for food rich and food poor. Rich wants more good quality food whilst poor wants more lower quality food. -However, Rich is not inclined to spend all of their allocated currency, so they acctually consume less than their allocation Auctions have revealed willingness to pay for different kinds of food (who would have guessed that one pound of cereal was worth almost 50 pounds of produce?), which has allowed food banks to sort more efficiently on the quality\u2013 quantity dimension. In this way, the market system has allowed gains not possible with centralized assignment. No food bank has ever chosen to delegate bidding control to Feeding America except for cases where the director is on vacation for a short period. Even more striking is that food banks have never submitted a request for a special hearing by the Fairness and Equity Committee, and so thatcommittee has never convened.","title":"Food bank America"},{"location":"Econ1/HIC%20and%20LMIC%20Energy%20investment/","text":"A sizable literature has examined households\u2019WTP for efficiency improvements in HICs (e.g., Hausman 1979; Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer 2013; Greene, Evans, and Hiestand 2013). However, these empirical findings may not apply to contexts that have different income levels, consumer preferences, and other factors. Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs) Notably, the comparison indicates that respondents\u2019maximum WTP for CFLs (250 KGS) is below the most conservative empirical estimate of the discounted private returns on investment (268 KGS). These findings suggest that there is a sizable \u201cefficiency gap\u201d between consumer valuation and estimated returns on the energy efficient technology. The evidence also suggests that insufficient information on the benefits from efficient lighting could suppress household demand in this context. Electric power transmission and distribution sector losses are substantial in LMICs, averaging 18.4 percent in low-income countries and 10.3 percent in middle-income countries in 2014. Distribution sector losses include metering inefficiencies, billing inefficiencies, and electricity theft. Consumers who are not metered, do not receive bills, or have little incentive to pay the bills that they receive may pay a fraction of what it costs to supply the energy they consume. These various forms of revenue collection inefficiency confer an implicit subsidy that can further reduce WTP for energy efficiency improvements. Ideally, energy efficiency policies and programs would be tailored to the political and institutional context in which they are being implemented. Although the value added by energy efficiency policy intervention in LMIC settings is potentially large, so too are the implementation challenges (Singh, Sant, and Chunekar 2012). For example, a limited capacity to raise revenue constrains a government\u2019s ability to finance energy efficiency subsidies, tax incentives, and other programs that are commonly deployed in HICs. Limited resources and governance challenges can also limit the effectiveness of building codes and appliance standards, which require enforcement and program oversight. The Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) program was designed to sustain markets for energy efficiency and significantly reduce the energy costs paid by Indian consumers. UJALA targets lighting, which accounts for an estimated 18\u201327 percent of total residential electricity consumption in India (Chunekar, Mulay, and Kelkar 2017), and seeks to increase sales of LED bulbs. Although energy savings over the life of the technology easily offset the additional up-front cost of LED bulbs before the UJALA program was introduced, adoption of efficient lighting remained low. Empirical analyses of the economic impacts of energy efficiency improvements typically em- phasize reductions in energy consumption and expenditures, associated reductions in emis- sions (e.g., reduced pollution from electric power plants), and, to a lesser extent, the welfare gains associated with demand rebound (see, e.g., Allcott and Greenstone 2017). These are the main sources of benefits from energy efficiency investments in HICs. However, in LMICs, other types of benefits could be important, and failure to account for them will underestimate the social value of energy efficiency improvements. We focus here on three potential sources of benefits: enhanced access to energy services, local health impacts, and improvements in industrial productivity. On the benefits side, lower carbon emissions and we posit that energy efficiency investments could also generate indirect benefits such as improved reliability, enhanced energy access, and increased productivity.","title":"HIC and LMIC Energy investment"},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/","text":"Learning Objective Understand how the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy decisions. When the FOMC announces that it will raise or lower interest rates, it\u2019s announcing a new level for a specific interest rate called the federal funds rate. But it doesn\u2019t directly set the federal funds rate, which you\u2019ll recall is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans in the federal funds market. Only banks and certain other financial entities can borrow and lend in this market. So in order to implement its new monetary policy decision to shift this interest rate, the FOMC needs to create incentives for banks that shift the supply or demand for loans in this market. Let\u2019s explore how it does this. The Overnight Market for Interbank Loans \u00b6 We\u2019ll begin by thinking through why banks sometimes need to borrow from each other overnight. When you deposit your paycheck in a checking account, the money doesn\u2019t just sit as cash in the vault. Banks make money by lending out the funds you\u2019ve deposited. But when you write a check to your landlord to pay your rent, you expect the bank to give that money to your landlord. Banks must keep cash on hand\u2014known as reserves\u2014so that they can make those payments. So banks face a trade-off: If they loan more of their money out, they make more revenue from borrowers paying them interest on those loans, but they also risk not having enough cash available to make payments like the one to your landlord. When they don\u2019t have enough cash on hand, they\u2019ll need to borrow money to make those payments. reserves - The cash that banks need to keep on hand to make payments. Tools the Fed uses to influence the federal funds rate: - Pays interest to banks on excess reserves - Borrows money overnight from financial institutions - Lends directly through the discount window - Buys and sells government bonds The Fed sets reserve requirements: a minimum amount of reserves\u2014that is, available cash\u2014that each bank must hold. They have to either hold these reserves as cash in their vaults, or on deposit at the Fed. Sometimes banks don\u2019t have enough ready cash to meet the reserve requirement or are short of what they need to make payments on a given day. As a result, they have a demand for funds, which they can meet by borrowing money overnight from another bank in the federal funds market. Other banks may have more cash than they need. These banks are willing to supply funds, lending their spare cash overnight to those who need it. The forces of supply and demand determine the price in this market, which is the interest rate charged on these overnight loans. It\u2019s called the federal funds rate because it is the price in the market for funds to meet the Fed\u2019s reserve requirements. reserve requirements - A minimum amount of reserves that each bank must hold. The Fed can try to influence the federal funds rate by changing the reserve requirement. If the Fed raises the reserve requirement, the supply of funds available in the federal funds market will decrease as banks are required to keep more funds in reserve and thus have less available for lending. This decrease in the supply of funds will raise the federal funds rate. In reality, the Fed doesn\u2019t change the reserve requirement very often. But this intuition can help you understand the tools the Fed does use, many of which are designed to encourage banks to hold more or less in reserves. These tools effectively shift the supply or demand of overnight loans to achieve the goal of changing the equilibrium interest rate in the federal funds market. These tools work well: Figure 4 shows that the actual interest rate\u2014called the effective federal funds rate\u2014is usually incredibly close to the Fed\u2019s target for the federal funds rate. (Notice that the Fed used to set a specific target for the interest rate, but since late 2008, it has set a target range.) Let\u2019s explore the tools the Fed uses to hit these interest rate targets. Figure 4 | The Federal Funds Rate Data from: Federal Reserve. The graph plots years from 1995 to 2020 against fund rates in percent ranging from 0 to 6 percent. The lines for effective federal funds rate start from 6 percent in 1995, drops at 1998, increases slowly by 2000 over 6 percent, decreases to 1.8 percent and further down to 1.5 percent, increases steeply to 5.2 percent to become target federal funds rate, to which it decreases suddenly to 0 percent to 2009 to become Target federal funds range, remains the same till 2015, and increases steeply to 2.3 percent 2021. Tool one: The Fed pays interest to banks on their excess reserves. \u00b6 In order to influence the federal funds rate, the Fed pays interest to banks on excess reserve balances\u2014the reserves they hold above the amount required. This effectively creates a minimum interest rate that a bank will charge before loaning its excess funds to other banks. (The Fed also pays interest on required reserves, but since those reserves are required, that interest doesn\u2019t affect banks\u2019 willingness to lend their extra cash.) If you can just leave your extra cash in your own reserve account and earn a 1% return with no risk of losing your money, you\u2019ll only take it out of your account and lend it to someone else if they offer a rate higher than 1%. As a result, the interest rate on excess reserves effectively serves as a floor on the interest rate at which banks will loan their funds. The higher this interest rate, the fewer reserves are available to loan to other banks, which will raise the interest rate on overnight loans. And so when the Fed wants to increase or decrease the federal funds rate, it raises or lowers the interest rate it pays on excess reserves. interest rate on excess reserves - The interest rate the Fed pays to banks on reserves that are in excess of required reserves. However, not all institutions in the federal funds market are eligible to receive interest payments on their reserves. So the Fed must use another tool to set an effective floor for the federal funds rate at those institutions. Let\u2019s turn to that tool now. Tool two: The Fed borrows money overnight from financial institutions. \u00b6 The Fed has another way of establishing a floor for the price of borrowing money: It can borrow from financial institutions and pay them interest on the loan. By engaging in overnight borrowing, the Fed increases the demand for overnight loans, which leads to higher interest rates. When it reduces such borrowing, it decreases the demand for overnight loans, which lowers rates. It does this primarily to have a tool to set an effective floor for the federal funds rate at financial institutions that aren\u2019t banks. Let\u2019s see how this tool works. The Open Market Trading Desk, informally known as the Desk, is a trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; traders at the Desk buy and sell government bonds. Government bonds are IOUs from the government, saying that the government promises to pay back a certain amount by a certain date at a particular rate of interest. The Fed isn\u2019t borrowing money itself, it\u2019s simply trading government bonds just like you might buy or sell government bonds (if you have a retirement account, you\u2019ve probably bought government bonds, albeit indirectly). The difference is that the Fed is trading these bonds in order to influence interest rates. The Desk engages in these trades in order to carry out the directions of the FOMC to influence the federal funds rate. The Desk is called the \u201copen market\u201d desk because it\u2019s required to buy and sell in the competitive open market. Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) \u00b6 A trading desk at the New York Federal Reserve Bank where the Fed buys and sells government bonds. The Desk is housed at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The Desk sells a government bond to a bank or other financial institution overnight, with an agreement to buy it back the next day at a higher price. These sales are called overnight reverse repurchase agreements. This might sound complicated, but the idea is actually pretty simple: If I sell you a piece of paper today and agree to buy it back at a higher price tomorrow, you\u2019re giving me your cash today and I\u2019m promising to give you more cash tomorrow. Effectively then, I\u2019m borrowing your money overnight, and the difference between the cash you give me today and the cash I\u2019ll pay you tomorrow is the interest I\u2019m paying you. That\u2019s what these agreements do\u2014they set an interest rate at which the Fed is willing to borrow money. These loans effectively set a floor for the federal funds rate\u2014because why would a financial institution lend its money to someone else if it could lend to the Fed and make more in interest? Overnight reverse repurchase agreements \u00b6 When the Desk sells a government bond to a financial institution, with an agreement to buy it back the next day at a higher price. Both paying interest on excess reserves and the rate of return on overnight reverse repurchase agreements put a lower bound on the federal funds rate. Together, this method of implementing Fed policy for the federal funds rate is known as the floor framework because it effectively sets a floor on how low of an interest rate a financial institution will be willing to lend to another. Floor Framework - The Fed\u2019s approach of setting other interest rates to put a lower bound on how low the federal funds rate will go. Essentially, the Fed raises the opportunity cost of lending in the federal funds market. Since no bank should want to lend at a rate lower than its opportunity cost, the alternative options the Fed provides for banks and other financial institutions to earn interest puts a lower bound on how low the federal funds rate will go. Tool three: The Fed lends to banks directly through the discount window. \u00b6 There\u2019s another way the Fed can influence the amount of reserves that banks hold, but the reality is that it isn\u2019t used that much. It can lend directly to banks through the discount window. It\u2019s called that because in the old days, there was an actual window at each of the district reserve banks, where banks sold their loans to the Fed at a discount and later bought them back. Essentially, it was a pawn shop for banks. It doesn\u2019t work quite the same way anymore, but the name has stuck. And the main idea is the same\u2014banks offer collateral (something they\u2019ll lose if they don\u2019t pay back the loan) and get a loan from the Fed that helps them meet their reserve requirements. The interest rate that the Fed offers through the discount window is called the discount rate, and it\u2019s typically set higher than the federal funds rate. It\u2019s important because it creates an upper bound for the federal funds rate. Banks prefer to borrow from each other at the federal funds rate, but if the federal funds rate goes above the discount rate, they can just borrow from the Fed at the discount rate. discount rate - The interest rate on loans that the Fed offers to banks through the discount window. So the Fed can affect the federal funds rate by operating as an alternative lender. When the Fed wants to increase or decrease the federal funds rate, it raises or lowers the discount rate accordingly. Tool four: The Fed buys and sells government bonds. \u00b6 The last tool is really more of a history lesson. Prior to 2007, rather than trying to influence the federal funds rate by setting an interest rate floor and ceiling, the Fed would buy and sell bonds until they achieved their desired interest rate in the federal funds market. If the Fed wanted to raise rates, it would tell the Desk at the New York Federal Reserve Bank that it should sell bonds. When a bank buys a bond from the Fed, the money it pays is taken from its reserves. With fewer reserves, the bank is more likely to need to borrow reserves and less likely to be able to supply them to other banks. By selling bonds, the Fed increases demand for overnight loans and decreases supply. The net result is that the Fed\u2019s bond sales push the federal funds rate up. When the Fed wanted to lower rates, it bought bonds. The money the Fed paid for the bond added to banks\u2019 available reserves. Because banks had more reserves, they\u2019d be less likely to need to borrow from another bank overnight and more likely to be able to lend. By purchasing bonds, the Fed decreases the demand for overnight loans and increases the supply. Therefore, the Fed\u2019s bond purchases push the federal funds rate down. Open market operations refers to the Fed buying and selling government bonds. Technically, overnight reverse repurchase agreements are a form of open market operations. But historically open market operations through buying and selling bonds were the primary way that the Fed implemented monetary policy decisions. open market operations - The Federal Reserve\u2019s buying and selling of government bonds to influence the federal funds rate. - In the 2000s, Fed officials began looking for alternative approaches to move interest rates because buying and selling bonds through standard open market operations didn\u2019t always achieve their desired federal funds rate. The financial crisis sped up some of those changes. Today the Fed uses a floor framework plus the use of an effective price ceiling through the discount rate. By setting the relevant prices\u2014that is, a floor and ceiling for interest rates\u2014and letting market quantities adjust, the Fed can precisely target the federal funds rate without having to indirectly try to influence this price by changing the quantity of bonds traded in the market. The Impact of Changing the Federal Funds Rate on the Rest of the Economy \u00b6 The Fed\u2019s decisions ripple out and affect every part of the economy. Ok, so now you know how the Fed adjusts its main tool\u2014the federal funds rate. But how does that affect you? Once the Fed has succeeded in moving the federal funds rate, the effects ripple throughout the economy. Banks adjust many of their interest rates such as those on credit cards, business loans, mortgages, student loans, savings accounts, and auto loans. Those interest rate changes then have broader macroeconomic effects. A lower real interest rate leads to more consumption and investment, an exchange rate depreciation, and higher net exports. This rise in aggregate expenditure leads managers to expand production, which requires them to hire more workers. Higher output leads more businesses to experience capacity constraints, leading them to raise their prices more frequently and by larger amounts, boosting higher inflation. People follow the Fed\u2019s decisions closely because they eventually affect nearly every corner of the economy, both in the United States and abroad. Let\u2019s see how all of this happens. A change in the federal funds rate percolates through to other interest rates. When the federal funds rate changes, banks reset the rate they charge borrowers because the marginal costs and benefits of making loans has changed. The marginal benefit to your bank of loaning money to you is the interest you pay. Its marginal cost is the opportunity cost\u2014the interest it could earn by leaving the money in its reserves, instead. When a lower federal funds rate leads this opportunity cost to fall, the cost-benefit principle tells banks to make more loans at any given interest rate. This increase in the supply of loans causes the interest rate that banks charge folks like you to fall. The federal funds rate directly impacts short-term and variable interest rates. Many variable interest rates\u2014such as the rates on most credit cards\u2014move directly with the federal funds rate. Some private student loans also have a variable rate. Your savings account may have a variable rate that adjusts with the federal funds rate. Changes in short-term interest rates also percolate through to longer-term loans. To understand why, realize that a longer-term loan can be thought of as a series of short-term loans. So when you pay a fixed interest rate on a five-year car loan, the bank can think of adding up the different interest rates it would charge over each month of the five years. Since the opportunity cost for the bank of making you a five-year loan is not making a series of short-term loans, it will only do so if the interest it earns is at least as great as what it could expect to earn on a series of short-term loans. As a result, long-term interest rates move when the federal funds rate changes, and how much they move depends on how long banks expect the federal funds rate to be at its new rate. Interest rates change the value of consuming today versus consuming tomorrow. For consumers and businesses, consumption and investment change with the interest rate because of the opportunity cost principle. When the Fed changes the federal funds rate, the effects filter through to change the interest rates you face on things like your savings account and credit cards, which affects your choices about how much to save or borrow. Similarly, the return on savings for businesses changes, as does the cost of borrowing. Likewise interest rates change how much the government pays to borrow, therefore potentially affecting how much the government has available to spend on other things. Interest rates change the value of the U.S. dollar. Fed decisions affect the U.S. dollar, which affects Japan and the rest of the world. Investors are global actors, seeking the highest risk-adjusted returns they can find. When U.S. interest rates fall, investing in the United States becomes less attractive. With fewer foreign investors trying to buy U.S. dollars so that they can invest in America, the value of the dollar falls. This depreciation means that it takes fewer yen, euros, or yuan (the currencies of Japan, Europe, and China) to buy an American dollar. When it takes fewer yen to buy a dollar, Japanese consumers can buy American-made goods more cheaply. If you\u2019re exporting apples to Japan, you\u2019ll get the same number of dollars, but it costs your Japanese customers fewer yen. And that increases demand for your exported apples. Indeed, when the dollar depreciates, people around the world will discover that American goods will be cheaper in terms of their own currency, leading them to buy more goods exported from the United States. The flip side is that it takes more dollars to buy goods priced in other currencies. In order for a Japanese auto manufacturer to receive the same number of yen, you must pay more U.S. dollars for a Japanese car. That price rise leads to a decline in the quantity of imported goods that Americans demand. If the quantity of imports declines by enough to offset the higher prices, then total spending by Americans on imported goods will also fall. All this means that low interest rates lead to a cheaper U.S. dollar, causing exports to rise and imports to fall, thereby increasing net exports. The opposite happens when interest rates rise: The value of the dollar rises, making U.S. goods more expensive and foreign goods cheaper, and this leads to a decrease in net exports. The Fed\u2019s decisions, therefore, percolate through the entire global economy because of their impact on global financial flows, exchange rates, and international trade. To summarize, a change in the federal funds rate changes real interest rates throughout the economy, which in turn changes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. EVERYDAY Economics \u00b6 The Fed just lowered interest rates. Does that mean it\u2019s a good time to borrow The Fed just lowered rates. Should you take out a car loan? When the Fed lowers the federal funds rate, other interest rates will follow. You\u2019ll likely be able to take out an auto loan for less as a result. So does this make it a good time to buy a car? The Fed hopes you think so\u2014after all, it\u2019s trying to boost spending with the lower rates. But whether this is a good decision depends on your personal situation. In particular, it\u2019s important to realize that the Fed lowers rates when it sees the economy weakening. That means that you should factor in the chance that you might lose your job. If that were to happen, would you still be able to make payments? Typically, young people are the most vulnerable to high rates of unemployment during an economic downturn. So be extra careful with your budget when you see the Fed lowering rates, and perhaps hold off on that car purchase until you\u2019re sure you could support yourself (and the car payment) if you lose your job.","title":"How the FED sets interest rates"},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/#the-overnight-market-for-interbank-loans","text":"We\u2019ll begin by thinking through why banks sometimes need to borrow from each other overnight. When you deposit your paycheck in a checking account, the money doesn\u2019t just sit as cash in the vault. Banks make money by lending out the funds you\u2019ve deposited. But when you write a check to your landlord to pay your rent, you expect the bank to give that money to your landlord. Banks must keep cash on hand\u2014known as reserves\u2014so that they can make those payments. So banks face a trade-off: If they loan more of their money out, they make more revenue from borrowers paying them interest on those loans, but they also risk not having enough cash available to make payments like the one to your landlord. When they don\u2019t have enough cash on hand, they\u2019ll need to borrow money to make those payments. reserves - The cash that banks need to keep on hand to make payments. Tools the Fed uses to influence the federal funds rate: - Pays interest to banks on excess reserves - Borrows money overnight from financial institutions - Lends directly through the discount window - Buys and sells government bonds The Fed sets reserve requirements: a minimum amount of reserves\u2014that is, available cash\u2014that each bank must hold. They have to either hold these reserves as cash in their vaults, or on deposit at the Fed. Sometimes banks don\u2019t have enough ready cash to meet the reserve requirement or are short of what they need to make payments on a given day. As a result, they have a demand for funds, which they can meet by borrowing money overnight from another bank in the federal funds market. Other banks may have more cash than they need. These banks are willing to supply funds, lending their spare cash overnight to those who need it. The forces of supply and demand determine the price in this market, which is the interest rate charged on these overnight loans. It\u2019s called the federal funds rate because it is the price in the market for funds to meet the Fed\u2019s reserve requirements. reserve requirements - A minimum amount of reserves that each bank must hold. The Fed can try to influence the federal funds rate by changing the reserve requirement. If the Fed raises the reserve requirement, the supply of funds available in the federal funds market will decrease as banks are required to keep more funds in reserve and thus have less available for lending. This decrease in the supply of funds will raise the federal funds rate. In reality, the Fed doesn\u2019t change the reserve requirement very often. But this intuition can help you understand the tools the Fed does use, many of which are designed to encourage banks to hold more or less in reserves. These tools effectively shift the supply or demand of overnight loans to achieve the goal of changing the equilibrium interest rate in the federal funds market. These tools work well: Figure 4 shows that the actual interest rate\u2014called the effective federal funds rate\u2014is usually incredibly close to the Fed\u2019s target for the federal funds rate. (Notice that the Fed used to set a specific target for the interest rate, but since late 2008, it has set a target range.) Let\u2019s explore the tools the Fed uses to hit these interest rate targets. Figure 4 | The Federal Funds Rate Data from: Federal Reserve. The graph plots years from 1995 to 2020 against fund rates in percent ranging from 0 to 6 percent. The lines for effective federal funds rate start from 6 percent in 1995, drops at 1998, increases slowly by 2000 over 6 percent, decreases to 1.8 percent and further down to 1.5 percent, increases steeply to 5.2 percent to become target federal funds rate, to which it decreases suddenly to 0 percent to 2009 to become Target federal funds range, remains the same till 2015, and increases steeply to 2.3 percent 2021.","title":"The Overnight Market for Interbank Loans"},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/#tool-one-the-fed-pays-interest-to-banks-on-their-excess-reserves","text":"In order to influence the federal funds rate, the Fed pays interest to banks on excess reserve balances\u2014the reserves they hold above the amount required. This effectively creates a minimum interest rate that a bank will charge before loaning its excess funds to other banks. (The Fed also pays interest on required reserves, but since those reserves are required, that interest doesn\u2019t affect banks\u2019 willingness to lend their extra cash.) If you can just leave your extra cash in your own reserve account and earn a 1% return with no risk of losing your money, you\u2019ll only take it out of your account and lend it to someone else if they offer a rate higher than 1%. As a result, the interest rate on excess reserves effectively serves as a floor on the interest rate at which banks will loan their funds. The higher this interest rate, the fewer reserves are available to loan to other banks, which will raise the interest rate on overnight loans. And so when the Fed wants to increase or decrease the federal funds rate, it raises or lowers the interest rate it pays on excess reserves. interest rate on excess reserves - The interest rate the Fed pays to banks on reserves that are in excess of required reserves. However, not all institutions in the federal funds market are eligible to receive interest payments on their reserves. So the Fed must use another tool to set an effective floor for the federal funds rate at those institutions. Let\u2019s turn to that tool now.","title":"Tool one: The Fed pays interest to banks on their excess reserves."},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/#tool-two-the-fed-borrows-money-overnight-from-financial-institutions","text":"The Fed has another way of establishing a floor for the price of borrowing money: It can borrow from financial institutions and pay them interest on the loan. By engaging in overnight borrowing, the Fed increases the demand for overnight loans, which leads to higher interest rates. When it reduces such borrowing, it decreases the demand for overnight loans, which lowers rates. It does this primarily to have a tool to set an effective floor for the federal funds rate at financial institutions that aren\u2019t banks. Let\u2019s see how this tool works. The Open Market Trading Desk, informally known as the Desk, is a trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; traders at the Desk buy and sell government bonds. Government bonds are IOUs from the government, saying that the government promises to pay back a certain amount by a certain date at a particular rate of interest. The Fed isn\u2019t borrowing money itself, it\u2019s simply trading government bonds just like you might buy or sell government bonds (if you have a retirement account, you\u2019ve probably bought government bonds, albeit indirectly). The difference is that the Fed is trading these bonds in order to influence interest rates. The Desk engages in these trades in order to carry out the directions of the FOMC to influence the federal funds rate. The Desk is called the \u201copen market\u201d desk because it\u2019s required to buy and sell in the competitive open market.","title":"Tool two: The Fed borrows money overnight from financial institutions."},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/#open-market-trading-desk-the-desk","text":"A trading desk at the New York Federal Reserve Bank where the Fed buys and sells government bonds. The Desk is housed at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The Desk sells a government bond to a bank or other financial institution overnight, with an agreement to buy it back the next day at a higher price. These sales are called overnight reverse repurchase agreements. This might sound complicated, but the idea is actually pretty simple: If I sell you a piece of paper today and agree to buy it back at a higher price tomorrow, you\u2019re giving me your cash today and I\u2019m promising to give you more cash tomorrow. Effectively then, I\u2019m borrowing your money overnight, and the difference between the cash you give me today and the cash I\u2019ll pay you tomorrow is the interest I\u2019m paying you. That\u2019s what these agreements do\u2014they set an interest rate at which the Fed is willing to borrow money.

Floor Framework - The Fed\u2019s approach of setting other interest rates to put a lower bound on how low the federal funds rate will go. Essentially, the Fed raises the opportunity cost of lending in the federal funds market.

It can lend directly to banks through the discount window. It\u2019s called that because in the old days, there was an actual window at each of the district reserve banks, where banks sold their loans to the Fed at a discount and later bought them back. Essentially, it was a pawn shop for banks. It doesn\u2019t work quite the same way anymore, but the name has stuck. And the main idea is the same\u2014banks offer collateral (something they\u2019ll lose if they don\u2019t pay back the loan) and get a loan from the Fed that helps them meet their reserve requirements. The interest rate that the Fed offers through the discount window is called the discount rate, and it\u2019s typically set higher than the federal funds rate. It\u2019s important because it creates an upper bound for the federal funds rate. Banks prefer to borrow from each other at the federal funds rate, but if the federal funds rate goes above the discount rate, they can just borrow from the Fed at the discount rate. discount rate - The interest rate on loans that the Fed offers to banks through the discount window.

Prior to 2007, rather than trying to influence the federal funds rate by setting an interest rate floor and ceiling, the Fed would buy and sell bonds until they achieved their desired interest rate in the federal funds market. If the Fed wanted to raise rates, it would tell the Desk at the New York Federal Reserve Bank that it should sell bonds. When a bank buys a bond from the Fed, the money it pays is taken from its reserves. With fewer reserves, the bank is more likely to need to borrow reserves and less likely to be able to supply them to other banks. By selling bonds, the Fed increases demand for overnight loans and decreases supply. The net result is that the Fed\u2019s bond sales push the federal funds rate up. When the Fed wanted to lower rates, it bought bonds. The money the Fed paid for the bond added to banks\u2019 available reserves. Because banks had more reserves, they\u2019d be less likely to need to borrow from another bank overnight and more likely to be able to lend. By purchasing bonds, the Fed decreases the demand for overnight loans and increases the supply. Therefore, the Fed\u2019s bond purchases push the federal funds rate down. Open market operations refers to the Fed buying and selling government bonds. Technically, overnight reverse repurchase agreements are a form of open market operations. But historically open market operations through buying and selling bonds were the primary way that the Fed implemented monetary policy decisions. open market operations - The Federal Reserve\u2019s buying and selling of government bonds to influence the federal funds rate. - In the 2000s, Fed officials began looking for alternative approaches to move interest rates because buying and selling bonds through standard open market operations didn\u2019t always achieve their desired federal funds rate. The financial crisis sped up some of those changes. Today the Fed uses a floor framework plus the use of an effective price ceiling through the discount rate. By setting the relevant prices\u2014that is, a floor and ceiling for interest rates\u2014and letting market quantities adjust, the Fed can precisely target the federal funds rate without having to indirectly try to influence this price by changing the quantity of bonds traded in the market.","title":"Tool four: The Fed buys and sells government bonds."},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/#the-impact-of-changing-the-federal-funds-rate-on-the-rest-of-the-economy","text":"The Fed\u2019s decisions ripple out and affect every part of the economy. Ok, so now you know how the Fed adjusts its main tool\u2014the federal funds rate. But how does that affect you? Once the Fed has succeeded in moving the federal funds rate, the effects ripple throughout the economy. Banks adjust many of their interest rates such as those on credit cards, business loans, mortgages, student loans, savings accounts, and auto loans. Those interest rate changes then have broader macroeconomic effects. A lower real interest rate leads to more consumption and investment, an exchange rate depreciation, and higher net exports. This rise in aggregate expenditure leads managers to expand production, which requires them to hire more workers. Higher output leads more businesses to experience capacity constraints, leading them to raise their prices more frequently and by larger amounts, boosting higher inflation. People follow the Fed\u2019s decisions closely because they eventually affect nearly every corner of the economy, both in the United States and abroad. Let\u2019s see how all of this happens. A change in the federal funds rate percolates through to other interest rates. When the federal funds rate changes, banks reset the rate they charge borrowers because the marginal costs and benefits of making loans has changed. The marginal benefit to your bank of loaning money to you is the interest you pay. Its marginal cost is the opportunity cost\u2014the interest it could earn by leaving the money in its reserves, instead. When a lower federal funds rate leads this opportunity cost to fall, the cost-benefit principle tells banks to make more loans at any given interest rate. This increase in the supply of loans causes the interest rate that banks charge folks like you to fall. The federal funds rate directly impacts short-term and variable interest rates. Many variable interest rates\u2014such as the rates on most credit cards\u2014move directly with the federal funds rate. Some private student loans also have a variable rate. Your savings account may have a variable rate that adjusts with the federal funds rate. Changes in short-term interest rates also percolate through to longer-term loans. To understand why, realize that a longer-term loan can be thought of as a series of short-term loans. So when you pay a fixed interest rate on a five-year car loan, the bank can think of adding up the different interest rates it would charge over each month of the five years. Since the opportunity cost for the bank of making you a five-year loan is not making a series of short-term loans, it will only do so if the interest it earns is at least as great as what it could expect to earn on a series of short-term loans. As a result, long-term interest rates move when the federal funds rate changes, and how much they move depends on how long banks expect the federal funds rate to be at its new rate. Interest rates change the value of consuming today versus consuming tomorrow. For consumers and businesses, consumption and investment change with the interest rate because of the opportunity cost principle. When the Fed changes the federal funds rate, the effects filter through to change the interest rates you face on things like your savings account and credit cards, which affects your choices about how much to save or borrow. Similarly, the return on savings for businesses changes, as does the cost of borrowing. Likewise interest rates change how much the government pays to borrow, therefore potentially affecting how much the government has available to spend on other things. Interest rates change the value of the U.S. dollar. Fed decisions affect the U.S. dollar, which affects Japan and the rest of the world. Investors are global actors, seeking the highest risk-adjusted returns they can find. When U.S. interest rates fall, investing in the United States becomes less attractive. With fewer foreign investors trying to buy U.S. dollars so that they can invest in America, the value of the dollar falls. This depreciation means that it takes fewer yen, euros, or yuan (the currencies of Japan, Europe, and China) to buy an American dollar. When it takes fewer yen to buy a dollar, Japanese consumers can buy American-made goods more cheaply. If you\u2019re exporting apples to Japan, you\u2019ll get the same number of dollars, but it costs your Japanese customers fewer yen. And that increases demand for your exported apples. Indeed, when the dollar depreciates, people around the world will discover that American goods will be cheaper in terms of their own currency, leading them to buy more goods exported from the United States. The flip side is that it takes more dollars to buy goods priced in other currencies. In order for a Japanese auto manufacturer to receive the same number of yen, you must pay more U.S. dollars for a Japanese car. That price rise leads to a decline in the quantity of imported goods that Americans demand. If the quantity of imports declines by enough to offset the higher prices, then total spending by Americans on imported goods will also fall. All this means that low interest rates lead to a cheaper U.S. dollar, causing exports to rise and imports to fall, thereby increasing net exports. The opposite happens when interest rates rise: The value of the dollar rises, making U.S. goods more expensive and foreign goods cheaper, and this leads to a decrease in net exports. The Fed\u2019s decisions, therefore, percolate through the entire global economy because of their impact on global financial flows, exchange rates, and international trade. To summarize, a change in the federal funds rate changes real interest rates throughout the economy, which in turn changes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.","title":"The Impact of Changing the Federal Funds Rate on the Rest of the Economy"},{"location":"Econ1/How%20the%20FED%20sets%20interest%20rates/#everyday-economics","text":"The Fed just lowered interest rates.

When your wage goes up, the opportunity cost of an hour of leisure goes up. It\u2019s as if leisure becomes more expensive, because you\u2019ll have to give up more money to get an hour of leisure. This is called the substitution effect because higher wages are an incentive to substitute more work for less leisure. The substitution effect is why people work longer hours when their wages rise, and so it leads to an upward-sloping individual labor supply curve, as shown in Panel A of Figure 6. The income effect measures how people\u2019s choices change when they have more income. You learned in Chapter 2 that your demand for normal goods shifts to the right when your income rises. Because your demand curve is also your marginal benefit curve, this also means that your marginal benefit of normal goods goes up when your income increases. So what does this mean for leisure? For most people, leisure is a normal good, so a rise in income means an increase in the marginal benefit of leisure. Thus a higher wage\u2014which boosts workers\u2019 incomes\u2014will lead them to choose more leisure, which means working fewer hours. There\u2019s another way of seeing this: A higher wage means that you have more income. What should you buy with your extra income? When your hourly wage rate rises, you don\u2019t need to work as many hours to buy the things you were purchasing before. Rather than spending your pay increase buying more stuff, you might spend it buying more leisure time. The somewhat counterintuitive result is that the income effect provides a reason for workers to cut their hours in response to a wage rise. The income effect leads to a downward-sloping labor supply curve, as shown in Panel B of Figure 6. The rise of new technologies is likely good news for economics students. Why? I\u2019ll quote Google\u2019s chief economist: If you are looking for a career where your services will be in high demand, you should find something where you provide a scarce, complementary service to something that is getting ubiquitous and cheap. So what\u2019s getting ubiquitous and cheap? Data. And what is complementary to data? Analysis. What\u2019s the leading framework for analyzing and interpreting data? Economics. Indeed, economics majors already earn more than most other majors. And as data becomes even more ubiquitous, your investment in understanding economics will become even more valuable. So keep reading, because studying economics is a great investment in your career. If you were on the board of a major corporation, how much would you be willing to pay to get the very best talent to run the company? Before you answer, I\u2019ll share with you the results of a recent study, which estimated that getting the very best chief executive will raise the value of your company by 0.016% more than the 250th best alternative. That doesn\u2019t sound like much. But if your corporation is General Motors, which is worth roughly $50 billion, then even this very small difference is worth an extra $8 million. That\u2019s a key reason big firms are willing to pay millions of dollars to get the very best managers. There\u2019s an important idea here: The more broadly you can spread your talent\u2014say, across a big firm or a big market\u2014the more likely it is that being slightly better than the competition will be enough to generate a multimillion-dollar pay deal. Compensating Differentials \u00b6 Have you ever thought of becoming a cosmetologist? If so, I\u2019ve got a great deal for you. There\u2019s a job that requires a similar amount of training, where you\u2019re also paid to make people look good, while also earning a lot more money. And your customers will never be rude to you, nor will they squirm while you work on them. The job? Mortician. Interested? Probably not. I mean, imagine the awkward first dates you\u2019ll experience as you describe what you do all day. Because morticians and cosmetologists require similar training\u2014both require a vocational degree\u2014we can infer that the differences in their pay aren\u2019t due to differences in their human capital. Instead, it\u2019s because it is unpleasant to spend your days looking after corpses. After all, why would you\u2014or anyone\u2014accept such an unpleasant job unless you were paid a bit more? The extra wage boost that you would earn as a mortician is called a compensating differential\u2014a difference in wages required to offset the undesirable (or desirable) aspects of the job. It\u2019s compensating, because it compensates you for the attributes of the job. And it\u2019s a differential, because it leads people with similar human capital to earn different wages. Compensating differentials depend on the preferences of other workers. Whether you\u2019re offered a compensating differential or not depends on how the market as a whole\u2014that is, other people\u2014view a job attribute, not how you view it. That means that if you hate dogs, don\u2019t expect to be paid a lot to work as a dog walker, because there are plenty of dog lovers who are thrilled to work with dogs, even if the pay is lousy. This insight is the interdependence principle in action. It also provides useful advice: Think about your tastes compared to those of other workers. You\u2019ll find a good match when you\u2019ve found a job whose positive attributes are even more important to you than they are to others. Or look for a job whose negative attributes don\u2019t bug you as much as they bug others, and you\u2019ll enjoy the extra pay without being so worried about those negatives. How much is a life worth? How much money would I have to pay you to risk your life? You can\u2019t say you\u2019ll never risk it, because you already take a risk of dying every time you ride in a car. So, how much? It\u2019s an important question, because it tells policy makers how much they should spend in trying to reduce these risks. And it\u2019s closely related to compensating differentials. One possible answer comes from analyzing how the occupational choices that people make reveal their own willingness to risk their lives. That is, you can compare the compensating differential that workers demand to enter risky industries like mining with that in less risky occupations. Recent research suggests that workers demand somewhere between $6,000 and $10,000 in extra income to compensate for a 0.1 percentage point increase in the probability of a fatal work injury. This means that, taken together, 1,000 workers accept an extra $6 to $10 million, in return for the likelihood that one of them will die. Stated this way, we can say that workers act as if they value one statistical life at $6 to $10 million! Monopsony power reduces wages. This means that the Hershey Trust has a lot of bargaining power. If it decides to offer low wages, your only options are to accept that low wage, get by without a job, or leave town. So even if your marginal revenue product is $1,000 per week, you might accept a job paying only $600 per week. This is an example of monopsony power\u2014a business using its bargaining power as a major buyer to pay lower prices, including lower wages. (And if monopsony sounds like an odd word, it might help to realize that just as a monopoly is the only seller of a good, a monopsony is the only buyer.) While Hershey is an extreme example, the same ideas apply in many other labor markets. The federal government is the dominant employer in Washington, DC. Universities are the main employers in towns like Ann Arbor, Ithaca, and Chapel Hill. A few tech behemoths such as Google, Facebook, and Apple play a major role in hiring tech talent in Silicon Valley. And monopsony power appears to be becoming more important in specific sectors of the economy. For instance, in the retail sector, mom-and-pop stores used to compete with each other for the best talent, and this competition would drive wages up. But today, many towns are dominated by one or two big-box stores like Walmart, and many of those big companies use their monopsony power to pay lower wages. There\u2019s a vibrant debate about how important monopsony power is in the broader labor market, and there are good arguments on both sides. Consider, for example, the market for teachers. By one view, the local school board is a lot like Hershey and has a lot of monopsony power, because it employs nearly all the teachers in the district. An alternative perspective suggests that teachers still have a lot of bargaining power because if they\u2019re unhappy with their pay and conditions, they can threaten to move to other districts or change occupations. Discrimination type one: Prejudice. When most people think about discrimination, they usually conjure up visions of bigots whose hatred of some groups of people causes enormous harm to those people. This is the problem of prejudice, which refers to a preconceived bias against a group that\u2019s not based on reason or experience. Prejudice remains a problem in some places and among some people, although in much of the United States the degree of prejudice\u2014including the hatred of one group or explicit favoritism of others\u2014appears to be declining. Prejudice A preconceived bias against a group that\u2019s not based on reason or experience. Economists sometimes call prejudice taste-based discrimination, because it\u2019s not based on reason, but rather on people\u2019s preference or taste for hiring one group over another. And prejudice is costly, not only to the victims of discrimination, but also to prejudiced employers. Why? A business is most profitable if it hires the most productive people at the lowest wage possible. If you\u2019re prejudiced against a group of people, you\u2019re limiting the pool of talent available to you. Selecting from a smaller talent pool means both that you\u2019ve limited the supply of workers competing for a job\u2014which leads to higher wages\u2014and you\u2019re less likely to find the most productive workers. It follows that it\u2019s costly to be prejudiced. Indeed, this points to a potentially profitable hiring strategy. If there are a lot of prejudiced employers in your labor market, then there are likely a lot of talented people who\u2014because of their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or sexuality\u2014are still looking for a job that uses their full set of talents. It follows that a savvy employer can find especially good workers by hiring folks that other employers are prejudiced against. Does this approach work? An owner of a Wall Street firm said that he hired a lot of women, reasoning that he could hire more talent at a lower price, because his competitors were prejudiced against women. If enough employers follow this strategy, they\u2019ll offset some of the effects of prejudice. In this way, competitive market pressure can help reduce the role that prejudice plays in the labor market. This logic also illustrates how prejudice can sometimes lead to segregation. For example, a century ago, most car makers would not hire black workers, but Ford saw an opportunity to hire talented workers who were overlooked by their rivals. The result was a segregated workforce, with mostly white workers at General Motors and mainly black workers at Ford. Discrimination type two: Implicit bias. Psychologists have recently developed a more subtle understanding of discrimination that recognizes that people often try very hard not to be biased. While you may strive to be impartial, when you need to make quick judgments, your brain simply doesn\u2019t have time to make a complete analysis. And so without your conscious knowledge, your snap judgments may reflect implicit or unconscious associations. For instance, your brain may be more likely to associate masculine with aggression, or feminine with nurturing. It may even make associations between particular groups and honesty, tenacity, or leadership. The result is a form of discrimination based on implicit bias, in which employers\u2019 judgments are shaped by their unconscious attribution of particular qualities to members of specific groups. The problem is that these crude attributions can be harder to combat because you may not even be aware you\u2019re making them. For instance, even though people may not mean to discriminate when they tip their taxi driver, the quick judgments they form may help explain why black taxi drivers receive smaller tips than white taxi drivers. implicit bias Judgments shaped by the unconscious attribution of particular qualities to specific groups. As an employer, you want to hire the best person for the job, rather than allowing your unconscious attitudes to fool you into overlooking them. You can minimize the impact of your implicit biases by basing your hiring decisions on carefully structured assessments of individual candidates, rather than gut feelings.","title":"Wages allocation"},{"location":"Econ1/Wages%20allocation/#compensating-differentials","text":"Have you ever thought of becoming a cosmetologist? If so, I\u2019ve got a great deal for you. There\u2019s a job that requires a similar amount of training, where you\u2019re also paid to make people look good, while also earning a lot more money. And your customers will never be rude to you, nor will they squirm while you work on them. The job? Mortician. Interested? Probably not. I mean, imagine the awkward first dates you\u2019ll experience as you describe what you do all day. Because morticians and cosmetologists require similar training\u2014both require a vocational degree\u2014we can infer that the differences in their pay aren\u2019t due to differences in their human capital. Instead, it\u2019s because it is unpleasant to spend your days looking after corpses. After all, why would you\u2014or anyone\u2014accept such an unpleasant job unless you were paid a bit more? The extra wage boost that you would earn as a mortician is called a compensating differential\u2014a difference in wages required to offset the undesirable (or desirable) aspects of the job. It\u2019s compensating, because it compensates you for the attributes of the job. And it\u2019s a differential, because it leads people with similar human capital to earn different wages. Compensating differentials depend on the preferences of other workers. Whether you\u2019re offered a compensating differential or not depends on how the market as a whole\u2014that is, other people\u2014view a job attribute, not how you view it. That means that if you hate dogs, don\u2019t expect to be paid a lot to work as a dog walker, because there are plenty of dog lovers who are thrilled to work with dogs, even if the pay is lousy. This insight is the interdependence principle in action. It also provides useful advice: Think about your tastes compared to those of other workers. You\u2019ll find a good match when you\u2019ve found a job whose positive attributes are even more important to you than they are to others. Or look for a job whose negative attributes don\u2019t bug you as much as they bug others, and you\u2019ll enjoy the extra pay without being so worried about those negatives. How much is a life worth? How much money would I have to pay you to risk your life? You can\u2019t say you\u2019ll never risk it, because you already take a risk of dying every time you ride in a car. So, how much? It\u2019s an important question, because it tells policy makers how much they should spend in trying to reduce these risks. And it\u2019s closely related to compensating differentials. One possible answer comes from analyzing how the occupational choices that people make reveal their own willingness to risk their lives. That is, you can compare the compensating differential that workers demand to enter risky industries like mining with that in less risky occupations. Recent research suggests that workers demand somewhere between $6,000 and $10,000 in extra income to compensate for a 0.1 percentage point increase in the probability of a fatal work injury. This means that, taken together, 1,000 workers accept an extra $6 to $10 million, in return for the likelihood that one of them will die. Stated this way, we can say that workers act as if they value one statistical life at $6 to $10 million! Monopsony power reduces wages. This means that the Hershey Trust has a lot of bargaining power. If it decides to offer low wages, your only options are to accept that low wage, get by without a job, or leave town. So even if your marginal revenue product is $1,000 per week, you might accept a job paying only $600 per week. This is an example of monopsony power\u2014a business using its bargaining power as a major buyer to pay lower prices, including lower wages. (And if monopsony sounds like an odd word, it might help to realize that just as a monopoly is the only seller of a good, a monopsony is the only buyer.) While Hershey is an extreme example, the same ideas apply in many other labor markets. The federal government is the dominant employer in Washington, DC. Universities are the main employers in towns like Ann Arbor, Ithaca, and Chapel Hill. A few tech behemoths such as Google, Facebook, and Apple play a major role in hiring tech talent in Silicon Valley. And monopsony power appears to be becoming more important in specific sectors of the economy. For instance, in the retail sector, mom-and-pop stores used to compete with each other for the best talent, and this competition would drive wages up. But today, many towns are dominated by one or two big-box stores like Walmart, and many of those big companies use their monopsony power to pay lower wages. There\u2019s a vibrant debate about how important monopsony power is in the broader labor market, and there are good arguments on both sides. Consider, for example, the market for teachers. By one view, the local school board is a lot like Hershey and has a lot of monopsony power, because it employs nearly all the teachers in the district. An alternative perspective suggests that teachers still have a lot of bargaining power because if they\u2019re unhappy with their pay and conditions, they can threaten to move to other districts or change occupations.

It sells so many of them because the Billy bookcase is so cheap. And the Billy bookcase is so cheap because Ikea sells so many of them. This virtuous cycle arises because of the benefits of mass production (which are sometimes called economies of scale). When you\u2019re producing millions of bookcases, you can invest in creating incredibly specialized production lines that are much more efficient. For instance, rather than hiring skilled woodworkers to make the Billy, Ikea has programmed specialized robots to do most of the work, and they can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The automated production line is so efficient that it makes a new bookcase every five seconds . In addition, Ikea produces so much furniture that it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s largest purchasers of wood. This gives it substantial bargaining power, which it uses to demand cheaper wood, further lowering its input costs. Put it all together, and the opportunity cost of producing another bookcase is lower for Ikea than for any other business. These lower opportunity costs due to the benefits of mass production can be another enduring source of comparative advantage, particularly for large producers. The gains to buyers from allowing imports exceed the losses to sellers. There\u2019s a neat intuition underlying all of this. The main effect of imports is to lower the price of shirts, and if American producers wanted to, they could sell just as many shirts as before, just as American consumers could buy just as many as before. Indeed, if Americans didn\u2019t change how many shirts they bought or produced, then the economic surplus gained by American buyers due to international trade lowering prices would exactly equal the economic surplus lost by American producers due to these lower prices. But when the price falls, American suppliers minimize their losses by supplying fewer cheap shirts, while American buyers amplify their gains by buying more cheap shirts, often from international sellers. (Imports fill the gap between the decreased production by American sellers and the increased purchases by American consumers.) The net effect is that the amplified gains to buyers outweigh the minimized losses to sellers, and so imports lead Americans\u2014taken as a whole\u2014to enjoy more economic surplus. It\u2019s time to summarize what we\u2019ve learned about imports. It\u2019s always best to start with what happens to the price. Cheap foreign competitors cause the price of goods we import to fall. Buyers respond by raising the quantity they demand, while sellers respond by reducing the quantity they supply, with imports filling the difference. The lower price increases the consumer surplus of buyers, and decreases the producer surplus of sellers. And because buyers amplify their gains and sellers minimize their losses, the net effect is for total economic surplus to increase. Okay, that\u2019s the effect of imports. Now it\u2019s time to apply the same approach to analyzing the market for exports. There are at least two ways to make cars. The first involves assembly lines in Detroit, where skilled manufacturing workers\u2014assisted by plenty of robots\u2014transform steel into General Motors cars. The second way is less well known, but perhaps more amazing: You can grow cars in Iowa. Here\u2019s how. Buy corn seeds, sow them, and water them. With enough care, you\u2019ll soon have a field full of corn. Harvest this corn, and put it on a boat headed into the Pacific Ocean. Wait a few months, and the ship will return with Toyotas. Now just drive those cars off the boat. Voila! You\u2019ve harvested a crop of cars that you grew from seeds. The fact that this happened because the cargo ship stopped in Japan to trade corn for cars is beside the point. The cars were the direct result of the efforts of farmers in Iowa. Both of these methods of making cars employ plenty of American workers\u2014in one case, it\u2019s manufacturing workers in Detroit; in the other, it\u2019s farm workers in Iowa. And they each produce high-quality cars. So why would we prefer one approach to the other? This question is central to the trade debate, because when people argue for protecting American industries from international competition, they\u2019re effectively arguing that we should build cars in Detroit, and stop growing them in Iowa. But that\u2019s inefficient. When there are different ways to make something, we typically let different producers compete with each other, letting buyers choose to buy from the lowest-cost producer. But if we force Americans to buy Detroit-made cars, even if it\u2019s cheaper to grow them in Iowa, then we\u2019ll end up paying more for our cars. This efficiency loss is a major reason not to limit international trade. Free trade in the solar system? Despite this, many people still argue that international trade is \u201cunfair.\u201d For instance, some say that it is unfair for American workers to compete with China, because workers there are paid less than one-twentieth American wages. And they say it\u2019s unfair that America buys more from China than China buys from us. The Alliance for American Manufacturing made these arguments in a letter to The New York Times, shown in the left column, below. Presumably, it is hoping these arguments will convince the government to reduce Chinese imports into the United States. One way to assess the validity of an argument is to consider its implications in an analogous setting. The right column shows an analogous letter that we imagined the American light-bulb manufacturers might write, complaining about the cheap imports of light, not from another country, but from even further away\u2014from the Sun! The letter from Alliance for American Manufacturing reads, To the Editor: No thoughtful discussion about the impact of trade on workers, consumers, and America\u2019s economic future can take place without recognition of the role that China plays in today\u2019s global marketplace. While many factors affect employment and wages in the United States, it\u2019s wrong to minimize or dismiss the role of trade, especially with China. Our lopsided trade deficit with Beijing\u2014256 billion dollars last year alone\u2014highlights its market-distorting practices, including subsidies, dumping, currency manipulation, counterfeiting, and lax labor and environmental standards. These unfair trade practices have cost 1.8 million American jobs since 2001, according to an Economic Policy Institute study. American consumers pay in other ways: unsafe and uninspected food, toys, and medication, and higher local taxes when factories close. Until we insist that China honor its commitments, American workers will continue to lose. Scott Paul, Executive Director Alliance for American Manufacturing The letter from Alliance for Light-Bulb Manufacturing reads, To the Editor: No thoughtful discussion about the impact of trade on workers, consumers, and America\u2019s economic future can take place without recognition of the role that the Sun plays in today\u2019s global marketplace for light. While many factors affect employment and wages in the United States, it\u2019s wrong to minimize or dismiss the role of trade, especially with the Sun. Our lopsided trade deficit with the Sun is a big problem: We import all of our natural light from the Sun, while the Sun buys none of our products. The problem is market-distorting practices that allow the Sun to export light at an unfair price of 0 dollar. Also, the Sun has lax labor and environmental standards. (It has none.) These unfair trade practices have cost American light-bulb manufacturers dearly. If we all used artificial light during the day instead of just at night, it would double employment in the industry. American consumers pay for sunlight in other ways: The sun causes cancer, it makes us hot during the summer, and it causes higher local taxes when light-bulb factories close. The Alliance for American Manufacturing is hoping that its arguments will convince the government to ban or tax imports from China. Do you find its argument convincing? If so, why shouldn\u2019t the (fake) Alliance for Light-Bulb Manufacturing also get similar protection? It\u2019s easy to do\u2014we could just require that buildings eliminate their windows to protect light-bulb manufacturers from the Sun\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d competition! That sounds absurd, but that\u2019s sort of the point of this story. Step one: What will the new price be? This tariff adds $4 to the trade costs of importers. Because the world price of $12 is fixed, importers have to pay the world price of $12 plus the tariff of $4. Therefore, the price of shirts rises by $4, to $16. Step two: At this new price, what quantities will be demanded and supplied? Consult the domestic supply and demand curves to discover that at the new higher price, the quantity demanded by domestic buyers is lower, while the quantity supplied by domestic suppliers is higher. Step three: What quantity will be traded? Recall that imports make up the gap between the quantities demanded and supplied. Because this gap shrinks, imports fall. OK, so given these effects, who wins and who loses from a tariff? Domestic buyers are unhappy because the higher price means they either pay an extra $4 per shirt or buy fewer shirts. Their consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the price. Before the tariff, this was equal to the triangle made up of the areas A + B + C + D + E + F. After the tariff, this falls to area A + B. Thus, tariffs cause consumer surplus to fall by area C + D + E + F. Domestic suppliers are happy because the higher price means higher profit margins on each shirt sold and they also sell an increased quantity. Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the price. Without a tariff, this was area G. After the tariff, it is area C + G. Thus, tariffs cause producer surplus to rise by an amount equal to area C. The government also gains because it collects $4 of revenue for each shirt imported. This total tax revenue is equal to the $4 tax (which is the height of rectangle E) times the total number of imports (the width of rectangle E). So the tariff yields tax revenue equal to the height times width\u2014that is, the area of rectangle E. Adding all this up, consumers lose C + D + E + F; producers gain C; and the government gains E. Hence, in total, a tariff will decrease the economic surplus of Americans by an amount equal to area D + F. If you\u2019re worried that Figure 9 looks complicated, don\u2019t be. It\u2019s really not so bad. The charts below show how we built this figure. We started by analyzing outcomes without a tariff. Then we analyzed the case with a tariff, tracking consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue. Finally, we looked to see what changed. The first graph is labeled no tariff. The area enclosed by the point of intersection of the domestic demand on the world price line and the world plus line is labeled as consumer plus. The area between the point of intersection of the domestic supply curve on the world price line to the point of origin of the domestic supply is labeled producer surplus. The second graph is labeled with a 4-dollar tariff. A line is drawn parallel to the horizontal axis at a price value of 16 dollars. The area between the point of intersection of the domestic demand on world price with tariff line and the line itself is labeled consumer surplus. The area between the point of intersection of domestic supply on the world price with tariff line to the point of origin of domestic supply is labeled producer surplus. The rectangular area between the point of intersection of the domestic supply with world price with tariff and the point of intersection of domestic demand to world price with tariff enclosed with world price curve is marked as Government revenue. The third graph labeled Difference plots reduced economic surplus. The area between the point of intersection of domestic demand with world price along with tariff to the point of intersection of domestic demand with world price is labeled reduced economic surplus. The area between the point of intersection of domestic supply with world price along with tariff to the point of intersection of domestic supply with world price is also labeled reduced economic surplus. And the end result is worth all this work. We\u2019ve found that taxing goods made in other countries actually reduces the total economic surplus of Americans! If this is surprising, here\u2019s the intuition: The extra government revenue isn\u2019t really a gain, because it\u2019s effectively paid by American consumers who now pay an extra $4 for each shirt they import. And so the tariff shifts money from one set of Americans (consumers) to another (the government). The tariff also raises the price of shirts, which distorts both the choices that consumers make (they\u2019ll buy fewer shirts) and the choices that producers make (they keep producing even when it\u2019s not efficient to do so). Red tape is like a tariff because it raises costs, but it doesn\u2019t even raise revenue. Tariffs aren\u2019t the only tool that governments use to reduce international trade. Consider what it takes to export a bicycle to Bujumbura, a city in Burundi where bikes are often used as taxis. Even once you\u2019ve shipped that bike to the nearest port in Tanzania, it has to wait for 50 days of pre-arrival approvals, 8 days of port handling, 15 days to go through customs, and then a month on a train. Once the bike arrives at the border of Burundi, it then takes another 12 days to get through customs again, be loaded on a barge, and then go through customs again at Bujumbura port. The 124 days, 19 documents, and 55 signatures required to get a bike to Bujumbura aren\u2019t just a headache; they add a lot to your trading costs. Given all the red tape, it\u2019s a miracle this bicycle ever made it to Burundi! All this red tape ultimately has the same effect as a tariff\u2014it increases trade costs and so raises the price of American-made bikes. The effects of this higher price is the same, whether it\u2019s caused by tariffs or red tape: It reduces the quantity demanded, raises the quantity supplied by domestic sellers, and therefore reduces international trade. But red tape is more inefficient than a tariff, because it doesn\u2019t even raise revenue for the government. Import quotas have similar effects to tariffs, but don\u2019t raise revenue. Tariffs and red tape affect trade because they raise the price of foreign goods, reducing the quantity of international trade. However, setting an import quota would also have the same impact. An import quota limits the quantity of a good that can be imported. For instance, the $4 tariff on shirts in Figure 9 reduces imports to a quantity equal to the width of rectangle E. The government could achieve the exact same outcome\u2014the same price and the same quantity demanded, supplied, and imported\u2014if instead it imposed a quota limiting imports to this number. However with a quota, the government wouldn\u2019t raise revenue the way it does with tariffs (unless it auctioned off the scarce import licenses).","title":"Comp adv intnl trade"},{"location":"Econ1/econ_basics/","text":"econ 1 first disc: Stores SUPPLY DEERMINANTS subsidies and taxes Technology Other related goods prices -> Substitutes and Complements in production (of not just one good) - Linear PPF -> Rather than the curves one Resource costs Expectation Special circumstances DEMAND DETERMINANTS: T-Taste R - Related goods prices I - Income levels B - Buyer information E - Expectation S - Special circumstances","title":"Econ basics"},{"location":"Econ1/econ_disc_104/","text":"Midterm Couple of multiple choice questions: And then a bunch of multi-part exams.

Higher taxes reduce incentive to work 2. Welfare reduces the incentive to work => Leaky Bucket The efficiency cost of income tax - Income tax is distortive because it discourages people from working Example: - Small business owner makes $60,000 before taxes - If tax = 20%, he keeps $48,000 after taxes - If tax = 33%, he keeps $40,000 after taxes Public finance Income Tax Consumption Tax - Some economists advocate taxing consumption instead of income - Restore incentive to save - Better for long-run economic growth - Common in Europe But, it is perceived as unfair . Equity-efficiency trade off. - Tax on consumption is fixed percentage, therefore it takes up higher percentage of income from the low income - Also, lower income individuals spend a higher proportion of their money on consumption, since higher-income individuals often look to investments and more high value purchases, and their consumption takes up smaller percentage of income. An example of a very inequitable tax is a lump-sum tax . Example: Lump-sum tax = $4000/person Income Average Tax Rate 20,000 20% 40,000 10% Lump-Sum Taxes A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax - Causes no deadweight loss. Does not distort incentives But it is unfair : - Relative to income, the poor pay more than the rich. - Equity-efficiency trade off Assets not equal to income Assets - Time, Land, Stocks, etc, not taxed Income - Taxed unfortunately.

The share of labour force who are unemployed Example: When lawyer gets fired from his $200,000 dollar lawyer job to work in Mcdonalds, we see that the U-rate doesn't take this into account. How can Unemployment exist? - In most markets supply=demand - If there is unemployment, it means that labor supply>labor demand - How can this be? Unemployment arises when labour demand is weak Types of Unemployment - Frictional - Occurs when workers spend time searching for the jobs that best suit their skills - The economy is always changing, so some frictional unemployment is inevitable - This type of unemployment is short-term - Unemployment insurance and other income support increase frictional unemployment - Structural - Structural unemployemnt occurs when wages are unable to fall to the market-clearing wage. This creates labour surplus - In well-functioning labor market, equilibrium occurs where labor supply equals labor demand and no structural unemployment exists. - Cyclical - - When wages can easily adjust to market conditions, equilibrium occurs at the market-clearing wage, where the labor-supply curve meets the labor demand curve and there is no unemployment - Sometimes,, the bargained wage gets stuck above the market-clearing wage - As a result, there's a persistent gap between the supply of labor and the demand for it. This causes structural unemployemnt Causes of Structural Unemployment 1. Unions keep wages high for some workers. 2. Job protection regulations make it hard to fire workers. 1. Therefore, Businesses are reluctant to hire new workers. 3. Minimum wage laws prevent wages from falling to the market-clearing wage 1. Not really a great source of structural unemployment - Conclusion by nobel prize winner 2. Changes in minimum wage found similar unemployment. This happenes only in small changes in minimum wages. 4. Efficiency wages (higher wage paid to encourage greater worker productivity) Bottom Line Frictional unemployment occurs when there ar Structural unemployment occurs when there are not enough jobs for everyone. Social Costs of Unemployment Unemployment is isolating and painful Long-term unemploymnet is associated with worse outcomes -> Life expectancy, morbidity, clinical depression Children whose parents experience unemployment suffer -> Worse academic, mental, and future economic outcomes. 1 year or more = long-term.

Inflation Expectations \u00b6 High-inflation countries are stuck in a vicious cycle High inflation -> high inflation expectations -> high inflation Low-inflation countries enjoy a virtuous cycle: Low inflation -> low inflation expectations -> low inflation In the long-run, the key to persistent low inflation is to convince people that inflation is going to be low (for some time) Measuring Inflation Expectations \u00b6 There are three methods for meausring inflation expectations: - Survey of consumers - Surveys and forecasts of economists - Financial Markets Output Gap and Inflation \u00b6 1) A positive output gap drives inflation to rise above inflation expectations A strong economy increases the demand for goods and services => the quantity demnaded exceeds the quantity supplied => excess demand => output gap is positive => prices increase. This is demand-pull inflation; excess demand leads inflation to rise above inflation expectations.

Uber\u2019s surge-pricing algorithm has kicked in. It\u2019s like a turbo-charged Phillips curve, programmed to respond to excess demand by raising prices immediately.

These different curves summarize different trade-offs . In a microeconomic context , the key opportunity cost of buying gasoline is not buying something else. But in a macroeconomic context we\u2019re focused on spending on all goods and services, and so the relevant opportunity cost of buying output today is that you can\u2019t save your money so that you can buy more output in the future. In micro, the key trade-offs are across products, while in macro the key trade-offs are across time. Aggregate expenditure is the sum of four components: ==Consumption: ==When households buy goods and services + Planned investment: When businesses purchase new capital + Government purchases: When the government buys goods and services + Net exports: Spending by foreigners on American-made exports, less spending by Americans on foreign-made imports. Economists often use abbreviations to simplify things, and so you might find it easier to write it this way: The thing is, if you can quiet your fear of not sleeping, you\u2019ll find it easier to fall asleep. If you believe you can fall asleep, you probably will. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. The same kind of self-fulfilling prophecy that prevents you from getting to sleep can cause an economic boom or bust. If you fear that a recession\u2019s looming, you might spend less. The problem is that if lots of people fear that a recession is looming, then lots of people will spend less, and aggregate demand will decrease. So if people fear a recession, there will probably be a recession. Pessimistic beliefs about the economy can create a pessimistic reality. President Franklin D. Roosevelt summarized this logic toward the end of the Great Depression, famously telling Americans that \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d A strong economy with high GDP is good news for Outback Steakhouse because when incomes are high, your customers are more willing to splurge on a steak dinner. When the economy is doing particularly well, you\u2019ll find your restaurants overflowing with customers, and you\u2019ll need to pay your staff overtime to keep up. Even then, you might not be able to keep up, and some of your customers might leave rather than wait two hours for a table. A strong economy can lead to excess demand given your limited seating capacity. In the long run, if business continues to boom, it\u2019s worth building more restaurants. But that takes years; in the short run, you\u2019re stuck with your existing seating capacity, which means it\u2019s time to raise your prices. After all, even with higher prices, you can still fill your restaurant. And those higher prices will help cover your overtime bill. When GDP is low, millions of businesses face insufficient demand. Like Outback, most will find that their marginal costs are low when they\u2019re producing well below their capacity. They\u2019ll follow the same logic as Jeff Smith and respond to insufficient demand with lower prices. The result is that in periods of low GDP, the average price level across the whole economy will tend to be a bit lower than it would otherwise be. Lower production costs lead businesses to charge lower prices. As a result, lower production costs reduce the average price level across the whole economy (at any given level of output), thereby shifting the aggregate supply curve downward or to the right. Because this shift leads to an increase in the quantity of output associated with any given price, we say that lower production costs lead to an increase in aggregate supply. This increase arises because lower production costs boost the profitability of producing stuff, leading suppliers to increase the quantity of output they\u2019ll produce at any given price level. Panel A on the left of Figure 6 shows that an increase in aggregate supply\u2014by shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right\u2014leads to both higher GDP and a lower price level. That is, it causes an economic expansion accompanied by deflation. (In reality there are often other factors driving inflation, and so this might lead to a decrease in inflation rather than outright deflation.) An inflation-induced response: Through 2008, widespread price restraint led the price level to be lower than it otherwise would be, and inflation fell sharply. When the Fed is worried that inflation is too low, it responds by cutting the real interest rate. We call this an inflation-induced response. - This form of increase in the interest rate will not affect the Aggregate demand curve at all, as the real interest rate changes exactly as expected An output-induced response: But the Fed cut interest rates much more dramatically than needed to offset the decline in inflation. It did so because it has another objective: promoting maximal employment and hence output. Thus, the Fed cut the real interest rate even further in an effort to combat the decline in GDP. We call this an output-induced response. - This actually shifts the output by shifting the Aggregate Demand curve Inflation will be lower when you forecast that the price level will be lower than it otherwise would be. These different responses over different time horizons arise because in the very short run prices don\u2019t adjust at all, leaving the burden of adjustment to quantities , while in the long run prices fully adjust, leaving none of the burden of adjustment to quantities . Let\u2019s now explore what happens in between\u2014over the months or years that are relevant to analyzing the ups and downs of the business cycle.","title":"Econ lec 18"},{"location":"Econ1/econ_lec_19/","text":"Final Exam \u00b6 RRR week - Additional OH (will send times by email) - 3 Review sections (will send times by email) - Micro (Meghana + Henry -- Zoom) - Macro (Meghana + Henry -- Zoom) - SLC (sign up on web site) Final Exam: - Online due to strike.

Jamie -> Can vacuum house in 4 hours or make meal in 1 hour. Comparative advantage ---> ALL about opportunity cost Opportunity cost principle -> True cost of something is what one must give up to get it. True cost of Helen or Jamie's vaccumming -> Need to ask \"Or what?\" To get the most output with your given inputs, you should allocate each task to the person with the lowest opportunity cost(when there are two exact tasks) And it shows that Helen will make the biggest contribution if she\u2019s assigned to the task that she\u2019s least bad at relative to Jamie. That\u2019s such an important point that I\u2019m going to say it again: You should allocate each task to the person who can do it at the lowest opportunity cost. This idea is called comparative advantage Comparative -> Opportunity cost compares what can be produced if assigned one task with what you would produce if spent time on another task. Advantage -> Lower opportunity cost means give up less to get task done How should they allocate two tasks? Gain from trade due to comparative advantage - Consider 9 hour work day - Output under specialization: - Lakisha; 3 wills - Zara: 1 employment contract - Output if they both do both tasks: - Lakisha: 1 will + 1 employment contract - Zara: 1 employment contract => Total output is larger under specialization It\u2019s often most intuitive to think of comparative advantage in exactly these terms: You have a comparative advantage in the task that you\u2019re least bad at.

Because of this externaltiy, we see that private consumers will definitely underinvest in the production of energy efficient systems Social versus private cost benefit calculation The energy efficiency \"gap\" - Decision makers apper to \"under-invest\" in (privately) cost effective energy-efficint tecchnologies, relative to the predictions of some engineering and economic models. - This energy efficiency investment gap looks even larger from a social perspective. - What market failures/barriers might explain this gap? - Market failures from the idea of lack of information A large literaure in economics has explored this gap (and policies designed to close it) in industrialised countries - Incomplete information - ... Energy demand growth is projected to occur primarily in developing countries (Team) investigates barriers to adoption of efficient fans by low-income indian households and evaluate interventions that could mitigate/eliminate these barriers 1. Do energy-efficient BLDC fans work well/save energy in low-income settings characterized by frequent outages and voltage flunctuations 2. What are the most important barriers to energy efficient fan usage BLDC fans use 67%-83% less electricity than the standard fan Households pay around 2 rupees per household for electricity, but the maintaining of households energy standards is at least 7 rupees. (indian gov subsidise) In theory BLDC fans are better as they save more energy in the long run, but then not for the typical Indian household. Indian govenrment hemorrhaging money by subsidising electricity. They don't rlly want to subsidise the fan as well. Review of Findings so far Review of key findings 1. EE fans perform well in settings characterized by supply interruptions and voltage flunctuations 2. EE fans are highly cost-effecive from a social perspective 3. EE fans are not cost-effective for low-income households paying subsidized electricity prices 4. EE fan demand among low-income households is high a price points that could be rationalized on the basis of external benefits. - Lack of regulation Policy implications - Absent policy intervention, India will see massive \"lock in\" of inefficient fans - Demand will be low for efficient fans unless we can somehow decrease costs. Solutions: - \"subsidy swap\" : direct benfeits transfer targeted at BPL households - On-bill financing: Households can pay off a BLDC fan purchase via a higher electricity price. - Fan trade-in/buy-back: Households who surrender an inefficient fan receive a rebate towards a BLDC fan.

This failure arises when there are bystanders who are affected by your choices and who can\u2019t easily shape them. As a result, their interests are ignored or underweighted. The key insight of this chapter is that when people make decisions without facing the full consequences of their actions\u2014that is, when externalities are involved\u2014bad outcomes can result. Examples of such extrenalities: - If I stand up at a concert, you won\u2019t be able to see the stage. - If I smoke near you, my secondhand smoke might cause you to get cancer. - If I take antibiotics too often, a resistant bacterial strain is more likely to form that makes antibiotics less effective for you. - If I choose to drive a big SUV instead of a smaller hatchback, then you\u2019re more likely to sustain a life-threatening injury if our cars collide. - If I\u2019m disruptive during your economics class, you\u2019ll probably learn less. - If I\u2019m trolling on social media sites, you\u2019ll find them less pleasant and less useful. Negative externalities create problems because people often make decisions without taking full account of the costs that their choices impose on others. But if they were forced to pay for the costs they impose on others, they might do something less annoying instead. When people fail to account for the costs their negative externalities impose, they do more of these activities than would be in society\u2019s best interest. When you plant a tree, it\u2019ll recycle carbon dioxide into oxygen, which improves air quality for everyone in your neighborhood. When you buy a big-screen television for your living room, your roommates will also enjoy being able to watch movies. When you work hard and earn a pay rise, you\u2019ll pay more taxes, which fund better schools, parks, and other government services that benefit your community. When you discover a brilliant new scientific breakthrough, other entrepreneurs might use your idea to launch their own new products. When you prepare before your study group meeting, your friends will benefit from your insights. When you exercise regularly, you\u2019ll become healthier and your health insurer will benefit because they\u2019ll likely spend less on your medical care. Positive externalities sound like a good thing, since in each of these cases, your actions help other people. But they still lead to market failure because people typically make decisions without taking full account of the positive effects of their choices on bystanders. As a result, they\u2019ll do less of these socially useful activities than is in society\u2019s best interest. That means that even better outcomes could occur if the benefits to society were taken into account. A price change isn\u2019t an externality because once you total up the effects, it generates neither costs nor benefits. Price changes aren\u2019t an externality, but rather a redistribution between buyers and sellers The forces of supply and demand often yield the best possible outcomes for buyers and sellers . The Rational Rule for Society: Produce more of an item as long as its marginal social benefit is at least as large as the marginal social cost. When businesses don\u2019t take account of the costs of the pollution they emit, they do more of it. This isn\u2019t just about gasoline: The same logic shows that any product involving negative externalities will be overproduced. This intuition also hints at a policy solution: Try to find ways to make polluters bear all the costs of their actions\u2014including the cost of pollution. These higher costs can counter the incentives that lead to the overproduction of products with negative externalities. If society could eliminate pollution at no cost, then their reasoning is right. But the reality is that cutting pollution is costly. It\u2019s costly because we can only cut pollution by also cutting those activities that cause pollution. Fossil fuels present a trade-off: They cause harmful pollution, but they also make life more convenient. The whole point of our analysis has been to find the right balance by taking into account all the costs and all the benefits of using fossil fuels. NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY AT WORK Some economists invited people to lunch to find out how much people ignore the costs they impose on others. Some folks were told they would pay only for what they personally ordered, and they spent about $9 each, on average. But those folks who were told that the whole table would split the bill ended up spending about $13 each. And when the researchers said they would pay for everyone\u2019s lunch\u2014which is the experimental equivalent of your boss paying for a corporate lunch\u2014the average bill rose to $22 per person POSITIVE EXTERNALITY AT WORK Positive externalities might just explain why you don\u2019t work out, eat healthy, study, or save enough. How? Psychologists view your mind as being engaged in an internal struggle between your current self and your future self. You can think of your current self as making decisions, and your future self as being like a \u201cbystander\u201d who is affected by the choices your present self makes. Let\u2019s see how this shapes your decision about whether or not to go to the gym. Your current self considers the cost of working out, which includes the effort required to go to the gym and exercise. But the benefits of working out mainly accrue to your future self, who\u2019ll enjoy better health. This means that your current self sees little benefit to working out. The problem is that your current self considers benefits that accrue to your future self to be an externality, and so your current self doesn\u2019t take them into account. Because your current self makes all the decisions, you\u2019ll exercise less often than is optimal for the \u201csociety\u201d of both your current and future self. This same logic applies to any activity where your current self bears the cost and your future self enjoys the benefit. That\u2019s why the same ideas might explain why you don\u2019t eat healthy food often enough, why you study too little, and why you don\u2019t save enough. These are both examples of an insight called the Coase Theorem, which says that when people can bargain costlessly and legal rights are clear and enforced\u2014so that it\u2019s possible to enforce these agreements\u2014then externality problems can be solved by private bargaining. For example, loud music benefits your head-banging neighbors, but when they\u2019re choosing the volume, they typically don\u2019t take account of the cost to your sleep. By paying your neighbor for quiet, you effectively raise the opportunity cost to them of playing loud music because that would mean forgoing your $5 side payment. You\u2019ve given your neighbor an incentive to consider the broader costs of their actions. Consider the externality problem facing executives at Google, which makes most of its money from online advertising. From Google\u2019s perspective, the more people who have access to the internet, the better, because then it\u2019ll sell more ads, increasing its profits. But to the cable companies that provide internet service, this extra profit is a positive externality\u2014they see Google as a bystander, and the extra profits Google earns are an external benefit of providing internet access. The result is that internet access is underprovided, relative to what would occur if Google\u2019s extra profits were taken into account. Can you think of a way for cable companies to internalize this externality? Google did, and here\u2019s its answer: It is building high-speed wireless internet networks in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia to reach people outside of major cities. This investment internalizes the externality that Google enjoys from more people being online, because it\u2019ll earn both the revenue that an internet provider would earn, as well as extra advertising revenue from having more people online. Mergers can solve externality problems. There\u2019s an alternative type of private bargain that Google could have considered: a merger. If it merged with an internet service provider, then the new combined entity would make decisions about where to build wireless networks, taking account of both the direct revenues from providing internet service, and also the extra advertising revenue that Google will earn. In fact, this is a key reason that companies are often involved in several lines of business. When there are externalities across different markets, it\u2019s profitable for a business to operate in each market, so that the folks at headquarters can make decisions that internalize all the externalities involved. Private bargaining won\u2019t always work, particularly when it\u2019s difficult or costly to reach a bargain. For instance, consider the global warming problem. The total benefits to slowing global warming exceed the costs, and so in theory, there\u2019s a way in which those who would gain from lower greenhouse gas levels could strike a bargain where they pay polluters to pollute less. The problem is that in practice, there\u2019s no way for billions of people spread all around the world to negotiate with millions of polluters headquartered in different countries. It may even be infeasible, because many of those who would benefit from addressing global warming are yet to be born, and so they can\u2019t bargain to protect their future Earth. That\u2019s why private bargaining isn\u2019t going to solve the global warming problem. Indeed, many of our most important pressing environmental problems affect many people, and so the cost of bargaining is high. Moreover, while many environmental problems are important to society as a whole, the benefit to each individual from solving them is small. (How much would you, personally, be willing to pay to save the spotted owl from extinction?) In these cases, there\u2019s no hope that bargaining will solve externality problems. And when private bargaining can\u2019t solve externality problems, it\u2019s time to look for other solutions. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll explore next. To see how a corrective tax works, put yourself in the shoes of an oil refinery executive trying to decide how much gas to produce. You\u2019ll focus on your company\u2019s marginal private costs, because that\u2019s what affects your bottom line, and you\u2019ll largely ignore the marginal external cost of the increased pollution (which is $2.10 per gallon) because it doesn\u2019t affect your profits. But a tax equal to the $2.10-per-gallon marginal external cost will lead you to respond as if you were taking account of the marginal external costs. Thus, the tax effectively internalizes the externality by making the costs of the negative externality internal to the supplier\u2019s cost-benefit calculations. When people cannot be easily excluded from using something, a particular kind of externality problem called the free-rider problem can occur, in which someone can enjoy the benefits of something without bearing the costs. For instance, if you enjoy beautiful architecture, breathing clean air, or living free from the risk of smallpox, you are likely free-riding on the work of others. Beautiful architecture, clean air, and the eradication of disease are all nonexcludable\u2014you can\u2019t prevent people who don\u2019t pay from enjoying their benefits. Free riders don\u2019t pay for the benefits they receive, and are therefore bystanders, enjoying positive externalities. As with other types of positive externalities, the market ignores the interests of bystanders, and as a result may underproduce the good, or even worse, fail to provide it at all. Whenever there are bystanders who benefit from your actions without contributing (that is, when something is nonexcludable), and when their benefits don\u2019t subtract from anyone else\u2019s (that is, when consumption is nonrival), then a positive externality results. As we saw earlier, activities involving positive externalities are underproduced, because buyers and sellers don\u2019t take account of the benefits to free riders. Other public goods are funded in more creative ways. For instance, while many radio stations rely on advertising, National Public Radio\u2014which is a public good\u2014is funded largely by social pressure to make voluntary donations. Likewise, many schools get parents to voluntarily provide public goods, such as cleaning up the school grounds or helping in the classroom, by relying on the social norms of parental involvement. Businesses try to turn public goods into club goods. A public good is nonexcludable and nonrival, but businesses have an incentive to try to find a way to make them excludable. For example, you could buy some land, build a road on it, set up a tollbooth, and only let people pass if they pay you. The road is now excludable, but still largely nonrival. Sure, there\u2019s wear and tear on the road, and too many people could cause congestion. But when there isn\u2019t much traffic, the marginal cost of a car is close to zero. Economists call these kinds of goods\u2014ones that are excludable but nonrival in consumption\u2014club goods. They are a type of local monopoly, and just like all monopolies left to their own devices, they charge a higher price, leading the quantity that they sell to be lower than the socially optimal quantity. What this means is that businesses often provide club goods, but they underprovide them. Here\u2019s how club goods are relevant: Businesses try to solve the problem of public goods by figuring out how to exclude people. If they can figure out how to exclude people, they can turn a public good into a club good. For example, cable television figured out how to turn the public good of broadcast television into a club good by scrambling their signal so only paying customers can get it. However, cable television is a nonrival good, and this means that the marginal cost of an additional viewer is zero. As a result, there are lots of people for whom the price of cable TV is set higher than their marginal benefit, even though the marginal cost of providing them with cable TV is below their marginal benefit. So while businesses can attempt to solve public goods by creating ways to exclude nonpaying customers, they don\u2019t fully solve the problems inherent in public goods since they underprovide club goods.","title":"Externalities"},{"location":"Econ1/meme/","text":"","title":"Meme"},{"location":"Excalidraw/Drawing%202022-10-29%2001.02.49.excalidraw/","tags":["excalidraw"],"text":"\u26a0 Switch to

Introduction: \u00b6 In \\(1\\) -D and \\(2\\) -D calculus, the focus was on functions that deals with either \\(1\\) or \\(2\\) variables. Using knowledge before, we could model states that depend on either \\(1\\) or \\(2\\) variables. A simple example is the vertical position of a ball thrown up into the air with respect to time. Assuming the Newtonian Framework of physics is true, we arrive at the below: \\( \\(x(t) = -at^2 +v_0t + x_0(t)\\) \\) \\(x(t)\\) : position, \\(a\\) : acceleration, \\(v_0\\) : initial velocity, \\(x_0(t)\\) : initial position In the real world, however, any object, states, or results usually depend on more than one variable . For example, the status of the stock market depends on the outlook of the market, the average income levels of investors, trade relations between countries, the population, and much more. On a lighter tone, my energy state/mood can depend on many things as well... how much I talked to my friends, how much sleep I got, how hungry I am, how many lectures I ditched, how many exams I aced, etc. To model such cases, we introduce the notion of functions of several variables , also called multidimensional functions or multivariable functions which are basically functions that can take on an arbitrary number of variables. From now on, these terms will be used interchangeably A function of n variables is any function, \\(f\\) that assigns to every ordered list of \\(n\\) variables \\((x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_n)\\) within a specified domain \\(D\\subset R^n\\) , a unique output \\(y\\) . The standard notation is: \\( \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_n)\\) \\) The goal is to introduce methods and formulae to successfully model and predict certain properties of such functions, in particular, critical points. This includes points of extrema and saddle points. With such methods, we are equipped to understand functions of several variables better. Limits and Continuity: \u00b6 As we attempt to analyse functions of several variables , it make sense that we redefine the idea of limits and the notion of continuity and differentiability that was obtained from single-variable calculus. In single-variable calculus , we defined a limit of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\rightarrow a\\) as the point in which \\(f(x)\\) approaches as \\(x\\) gets infinitesimaly close to \\(a\\) . To be more precise: Let us define a function \\(y=f(x)\\) with domain \\(D\\subset R\\) , and let \\(a\\in D\\) . If we have that for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) , there exists \\(\\delta>0\\) such that: \\( \\(|f(x)-K|<\\epsilon,Eq1\\) \\) as long as: \\( \\(|x-a|<\\delta, Eq2\\) \\) Then we can write the limit of the function \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\rightarrow a\\) is \\(K\\) , or alternatively: \\( \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)=K\\) \\) In essense, this thinking can be elevated to the multidimensional framework. What we are trying to do is essentially the same, evaluate a multidimensional function \\(f\\) around points infinitesimaly close to, but not at, a certain point \\(P\\) on \\(f\\) 's domain. However, to do so we need a new idea for distance, otherwise the idea of infinitesimaly close becomes inconcrete. The \\(n\\) -dimensional equivalent for the distance formula of two points \\((x_{11}, x_{21},x_{n1}),(x_{12}, x_{22},x_{n2})\\) is given by: \\( \\(d=\\sqrt{(\\Delta x_1)^2+(\\Delta x_2)^2+(\\Delta x_3)^2+\\dots + (\\Delta x_n)^2}\\) \\) assuming \\(\\Delta x_k = |x_{k2}-x_{k1}|\\) Taking this idea forward, we define the limits of multidimensional functions using a slightly altered version of Eq1 and Eq2 . Multivariable Limit : Let us define a function \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_n)\\) with domain \\(D\\subset R^n\\) , and let \\((k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n) \\in D\\) . If we have that for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) , there exists \\(\\delta>0\\) such that: \\( \\(|f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)-K|<\\epsilon\\) \\) as long as: \\( \\(\\sqrt{(x_1-k_1)^2+(x_2-k_2)^2+(x_3-k_3)^2+\\dots + (x_n-k_n)^2}<\\delta\\) \\) Then we can write the limit of the function \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_n)\\) as \\((x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n) \\rightarrow (k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n)\\) is \\(K\\) . With limits defined, we define continuity of a multidimensional function as follows: Multivariable Continuity : If for a function \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_n)\\) defined on domain \\(D\\) we have: \\( \\(\\lim_{(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n) \\rightarrow (k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n)}f(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_n) =f(k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n)\\) \\) given a point \\((k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n)\\in D\\) , then we have that the function \\(f\\) is continuous on point \\((k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n)\\) . Unfortunately, unlike the 1D equivalent, there is no easy way to prove continuity of a multivariable function , since there are infinite vector directions to approach any given point of a multivariable function. Partial Derivatives: \u00b6 With continuity established, it make sense that the next step should be attempting to find derivatives . However, just as discussed above, unlike in 1D, as opposed to only two, there are many directions to which a function can intersect a point in multidimensional space. The workaround is introducing direction to the calculation of derivatives. Now, rather than just blindly calculating derivative, we are now calculating the derivative(i.e. rate of change) of a given function \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)\\) at a specific direction in \\(n\\) -dimensional space, represented as \\(\\vec{v} = (k_1,k_2,\\dots,k_n)\\) . (Note: \\(|\\vec{v}|\\) is irrelevant, as long as \\(|\\vec{v}|\\neq 0\\) ) (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/partial_derivative.png) Now lets go back to the 2D variant. Let us have \\(z=f(x,y)\\) be the multidimensional function we are concerned with. To put the above definition in more formal terms, we are looking at \\(\\frac{df(x,y)}{d(x,y)}\\) at a certain point \\((a,b)\\) , where the infinitesimal change in \\((x,y)\\) is in the direction of some \\(\\vec{v} = (k_1,k_2)\\) . In particular, for the case of function \\(f\\) , there are two directions to calculate derivative we are most interested in, \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,0)\\) . This is because these two directions represent the scenario in which the slope(derivative) of the function \\(f\\) is dependent on only one variable, the \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) , respectively. In essence, for the direction \\((0,1)\\) , the derivative of \\(f\\) is irrelevant to the value of \\(x\\) , and likewise for direction \\((1,0)\\) . When solving for partial of \\(f\\) with respect to a variable, we will differentiate \\(f\\) normally with respect to that variable, except we ==set all other variables as constant. == Partials: For the 2D multidimensional function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , we denote: - \\(f_x(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y)\\) in direction \\((1,0)\\) - \\(f_y(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y)\\) in direction \\((0,1)\\) To extend the definition, we have for 3D multidimensional functions \\(w=f(x,y,z)\\) , we denote: - \\(f_x(x,y,z)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y,z)\\) in direction \\((1,0,0)\\) - \\(f_y(x,y,z)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y,z)\\) in direction \\((0,1,0)\\) - \\(f_z(x,y,z)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y,z)\\) in direction \\((0,0,1)\\) Second-order partial derivatives For the 2D multidimensional function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , we denote: - \\(f_{xy}(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f_y(x,y)\\) in direction \\((1,0)\\) - \\(f_{yy}(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f_y(x,y)\\) in direction \\((0,1)\\) - \\(f_{xx}(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f_x(x,y)\\) in direction \\((1,0)\\) Differentiability: A \\(2\\) -dimensional function \\(f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at \\((a,b)\\) if for any point \\((x,y)\\) that approaches \\((a,b)\\) , we can write the difference between \\(f(x,y\\) ) and \\(f(a,b)\\) as a linear combination of the differences \\((x-a),(y-b)\\) . In particular: If for a \\(2\\) -dimensional function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) with domain \\(D\\) , we can write: \\( \\(f(x,y)-f(a,b) \\approx f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)\\) \\) as \\((x-a)\\rightarrow 0, (y-b)\\rightarrow 0\\) at some point \\((a,b)\\) , accurate to infinitesimals of higher order with respect to \\((x-a)\\) and \\((y-b)\\) , we have that \\(f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at \\((a,b)\\) . Specifically, we must be able to write: \\( \\(f(x,y)-f(a,b) = f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b) + \\epsilon_1(x-a) + \\epsilon_2(y-b)\\) \\) where, as \\((x-a)\\rightarrow 0, (y-b)\\rightarrow 0\\) , we have \\((\\epsilon_1 \\rightarrow 0), (\\epsilon_2 \\rightarrow 0)\\) Tangent Planes: \u00b6 Now, we will attempt to make the idea of differentiation more visual by introducing tangents . In the 1D equivalent, the tangent to a function \\(y=f(x)\\) with domain \\(D\\) at a point \\(x=x_0\\) , where \\(x_0\\in D\\) , is a straight line that intersects the function through the point \\((x_0,f(x_0))\\) at only that point. However, in the 2D equivalent, the tangent to a function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) with domain \\(D\\) at a point \\((x,y)=(x_0,y_0)\\) , where \\((x_0,y_0)\\in D\\) , is a plane that intersects the function through the point \\((x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))\\) at only that point. https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPosy.png To find such a plane, we can use our knowledge of the partial derivatives defined above. Let us assume that such a plane intersecting a point \\((x_0,y_0,z_0)\\) on the function would have the equation: \\( \\(A(x-x_0) + B(y-y_0)+C(z-z_0) = 0\\) \\) Rearranging, we have: \\( \\((z-z_0) = -\\frac{A}{C}(x-x_0) + (-\\frac{B}{C})(y-y_0)\\) \\) Notice that, by setting \\(x=x_0\\) and \\(y=y_0\\) , we have that: \\( \\(z-z_0=(-\\frac{B}{C})(y-y_0)\\) \\) and: \\( \\(z-z_0=(-\\frac{A}{C})(x-x_0)\\) \\) Respectively. This means that the constant expressions \\(-\\frac{B}{C},-\\frac{A}{C}\\) must be equal to the partial derivatives in the \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) direction, or \\(f_y(x,y), f_x(x,y)\\) , respectively. Hence, for any 2D function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , we can write that the tangent plane at any point \\((x_0,y_0,z_0)\\) on the function can be written as: \\( \\((z-z_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)\\cdot (x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)\\cdot(y-y_0)\\) \\) To extend this idea, in general, for an \\(n\\) -dimensional function \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)\\) , we have that the tangent plane at any point \\((k_1,k_2,\\dots,k_n,f(k_1,k_2,\\dots,k_n))\\) can be represented as: \\(y-f(k_1,k_2,\\dots,k_n)\\) \\(= f_{k1}(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)(x_1-k_1) + f_{k2}(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)(x_2-k_2)\\) \\(+ \\dots + f_{kn}(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)(x_n-k_n)\\) Directional Derivatives: \u00b6 Extending on the concept of derivatives in functions of more than one variable, we introduce the idea of directional derivatives , and the way to calculate them. Essentially the directional derivative of any function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) at point \\((x_0,y_0)\\) in \\(f\\) 's domain, in any direction \\(\\vec{u} = (a,b)\\) is basically the value of limit: \\( \\(\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x_0+ha,y_0+hb)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h\\cdot|u|}\\) \\) The function of directional derivative of \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(D_uf(x,y)\\) With this concept defined, we can now find the derivatives of functions along any direction of travel represented by a vector \\(\\vec{u}\\) . In fact, we can write the directional derivative based on the partial derivatives calculated above. For any direction represented by unit vector \\(\\vec{u} = (a,b)\\) , we have that: \\( \\(D_uf(x,y) = f_x(x,y)a + f_y(x,y)b, Eq3\\) \\) The reason is that the above limit can be broken down into the sum of two limits , whereby we alter the \\(x\\) component and keep the \\(y\\) component fixed in one limit, and then vice versa for the other. This brings me to the definition of differentiability . A function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at a point \\(P(x_0,y_0)\\) on its domain \\(D\\) if it is continuous at point \\(P\\) , and has continous partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) at that point \\(P\\) . Furthermore, we can also write the above Eq3 in another way: \\( \\(D_uf(x,y) = <f_x(x,y),f_y(x,y)>\\cdot <a,b>\\) \\) Now, since \\(|\\vec{u}| =|<a,b>|=1\\) , we must have that, the maximum and minimum value of the directional derivative is \\(+|<f_x(x,y),f_y(x,y)>|\\) and \\(-|<f_x(x,y),f_y(x,y)>|\\) , which is a conclusion literally obtained using the definition of the dot product. The maxima and minima are obtained when the direction of \\(<a,b>\\) aligns perfectly or in the opposite direction of the magical vector \\(<f_x(x,y),f_y(x,y)>\\) , respectively. It makes sense, then, to call this special vector something special. Without Loss of generality, we will call the vector \\(<f_x(x,y),f_y(x,y)>\\) the gradient vector , denoted by the expression \\(\\nabla f\\) . I will reiterate: 1) Maximal directional derivative of any function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) occurs whenever the direction of travel aligns perfectly(is in the exact same direction as) \\(\\nabla f\\) . 2) Minimal directional derivative of any function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) occurs whenever the direction of travel aligns perfectly(is in the exact same direction as) \\(-\\nabla f\\) . Level curves \u00b6 Work in progreses. Max and Min Values: \u00b6 In general, we define there to be a local maximum in a function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) at point \\(P(x_0,y_0)\\) if there exists some \\(\\epsilon>0\\) , such that. \\( \\(f(x,y)<f(x_0,y_0)\\) \\) as long as the distance between \\((x,y)\\) and \\((x_0,y_0)\\) is less than \\(\\epsilon\\) . The local minimum is basically the same except we replace the above equation with: \\( \\(f(x,y)>f(x_0,y_0)\\) \\) Just like the \\(1D\\) equivalent, we see that, at points of local extrema, the derivatives must be equal to zero. Assuming the function \\(f(x,y)\\) is continous across its domain, the points that might be points of local extrema are points that satisfy: 1) \\(f(x,y)\\) is not differentiable at the point 2) \\(f_x(x,y)=0,\\) and \\(f_y(x,y)=0\\) . Specifically, for case (2), we have such a framework for determining the identity of the points. If for a function \\(f(x,y)\\) differentiable at point \\((x_0,y_0)\\) and we have: \\(f_x(x_0,y_0)=0,\\) and \\(f_y(x_0,y_0)=0\\) and we have the partial derivatives are themselves differentiable: Then we define \\(D=f_{xx}(x,y)\\cdot f_{yy}(x,y) - (f_{xy}(x,y))^2\\) . and evaluate it at point \\((x_0,y_0)\\) . If \\(D>0\\) , then we have that \\((x_0,y_0)\\) is a point of local minimum If \\(D<0\\) , then we have that \\((x_0,y_0)\\) is a point of local maximum . Lagrange Multiplier: \u00b6 Lagrange multipliers are ways of solving for the extrema points(that means, maximum and minimum points) of any function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) . However, rather than solving for the local min/max of the function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) , a typical problem Lagrange multipliers solve is a situation where we want to solve for points \\((x,y,z)\\) such that \\(f(x,y,z)\\) is an extrema point subject to constraints, like \\(g(x,y,z)=k, k\\in R\\) . Lagrange multipliers say that, to solve for extrema values of function \\(f\\) relative to constraint \\(g(x,y,z)=k, k\\in R\\) , \\(\\nabla f\\) and \\(\\nabla g\\) must point in the same direction. The reason for this is, given some level set of \\(g(x,y,z)\\) , \\(g(x,y,z)=k\\) , what we want is to essentially find the \\((a,b,c)\\) on this level set such that \\(f(a,b,c)\\) is maximal or minimal. To simplify the analysis and the explanations , we will now stick with \\(2D\\) functions. (Calculus Early Transcendentals, James Stewart) Above we illustrate an example of trying to find the maximum of some function \\(f(x,y)\\) relative to a constraint \\(g(x,y)=k\\) . We see that, if the level curves of \\(f(x,y)\\) and \\(g(x,y)\\) are not tangent to each other, then the value of \\(f(x,y)\\) can be maximised further, by traveling along the level sets of \\(f(x,y)\\) . However, when the level curves are tangent to each other, then there is no possibility of increasing the value of \\(f(x,y)\\) anymore. This occurs at exactly the point where: \\( \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g, \\lambda \\in R\\) \\) We call \\(\\lambda\\) the lagrange multiplier . The same idea can be extended to multiple constraint curves. If our goal is to maximise a 3D function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) with respect to two constraints, \\(g(x,y,z) = k, h(x,y,z)=m\\) , the potential points of extrema are represented by the set of points \\((x,y,z)\\) where: \\( \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g + \\mu \\nabla h, (\\lambda, \\mu)\\in R\\) \\)","title":"Chapter 14   Lagrange Multipliers"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2014%20-%20Lagrange%20Multipliers/#introduction","text":"In \\(1\\) -D and \\(2\\) -D calculus, the focus was on functions that deals with either \\(1\\) or \\(2\\) variables.

Now, rather than just blindly calculating derivative, we are now calculating the derivative(i.e. rate of change) of a given function \\(y=f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)\\) at a specific direction in \\(n\\) -dimensional space, represented as \\(\\vec{v} = (k_1,k_2,\\dots,k_n)\\) . (Note: \\(|\\vec{v}|\\) is irrelevant, as long as \\(|\\vec{v}|\\neq 0\\) ) (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/partial_derivative.png) Now lets go back to the 2D variant. Let us have \\(z=f(x,y)\\) be the multidimensional function we are concerned with. To put the above definition in more formal terms, we are looking at \\(\\frac{df(x,y)}{d(x,y)}\\) at a certain point \\((a,b)\\) , where the infinitesimal change in \\((x,y)\\) is in the direction of some \\(\\vec{v} = (k_1,k_2)\\) . In particular, for the case of function \\(f\\) , there are two directions to calculate derivative we are most interested in, \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,0)\\) . This is because these two directions represent the scenario in which the slope(derivative) of the function \\(f\\) is dependent on only one variable, the \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) , respectively. In essence, for the direction \\((0,1)\\) , the derivative of \\(f\\) is irrelevant to the value of \\(x\\) , and likewise for direction \\((1,0)\\) . When solving for partial of \\(f\\) with respect to a variable, we will differentiate \\(f\\) normally with respect to that variable, except we ==set all other variables as constant. == Partials: For the 2D multidimensional function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , we denote: - \\(f_x(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y)\\) in direction \\((1,0)\\) - \\(f_y(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y)\\) in direction \\((0,1)\\) To extend the definition, we have for 3D multidimensional functions \\(w=f(x,y,z)\\) , we denote: - \\(f_x(x,y,z)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y,z)\\) in direction \\((1,0,0)\\) - \\(f_y(x,y,z)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y,z)\\) in direction \\((0,1,0)\\) - \\(f_z(x,y,z)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f(x,y,z)\\) in direction \\((0,0,1)\\) Second-order partial derivatives For the 2D multidimensional function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , we denote: - \\(f_{xy}(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f_y(x,y)\\) in direction \\((1,0)\\) - \\(f_{yy}(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f_y(x,y)\\) in direction \\((0,1)\\) - \\(f_{xx}(x,y)\\) as the partial derivative of \\(f_x(x,y)\\) in direction \\((1,0)\\) Differentiability: A \\(2\\) -dimensional function \\(f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at \\((a,b)\\) if for any point \\((x,y)\\) that approaches \\((a,b)\\) , we can write the difference between \\(f(x,y\\) ) and \\(f(a,b)\\) as a linear combination of the differences \\((x-a),(y-b)\\) . In particular: If for a \\(2\\) -dimensional function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) with domain \\(D\\) , we can write: \\( \\(f(x,y)-f(a,b) \\approx f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)\\) \\) as \\((x-a)\\rightarrow 0, (y-b)\\rightarrow 0\\) at some point \\((a,b)\\) , accurate to infinitesimals of higher order with respect to \\((x-a)\\) and \\((y-b)\\) , we have that \\(f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at \\((a,b)\\) . Specifically, we must be able to write: \\( \\(f(x,y)-f(a,b) = f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b) + \\epsilon_1(x-a) + \\epsilon_2(y-b)\\) \\) where, as \\((x-a)\\rightarrow 0, (y-b)\\rightarrow 0\\) , we have \\((\\epsilon_1 \\rightarrow 0), (\\epsilon_2 \\rightarrow 0)\\)","title":"Partial Derivatives:"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2014%20-%20Lagrange%20Multipliers/#tangent-planes","text":"Now, we will attempt to make the idea of differentiation more visual by introducing tangents .

Introduction: \u00b6 In \\(1D\\) and \\(2D\\) calculus, a common problem that was encountered was solving for the exact area bounded by curves . For example, we may want to find the area bounded by the \\(y\\) -axis and the curve, sketched below: \\( \\(y=-x^2+5\\) \\) The idea is that such areas will be computed as the sum of the areas of infinite rectangles, each of height \\(y = -x^2+5\\) and an infinitesimal width denoted by \\(dx\\) . (https://jmahaffy.sdsu.edu/courses/f00/math122/lectures/riemann_sums/images/i_int40.gif) As shown in the above image, the sum of the green areas is an approximate answer for the actual area under the red curve . To find the exact area in \\(1D\\) calculus, we compute the integral of the function for which we want to find areas for, which is expressed as: \\( \\(\\int f(x)dx, Eq1\\) \\) for some function \\(y=f(x)\\) . The above expression represents an indefinite integral , as the bounds of integration are not defined. In general, the expression: \\( \\(\\int_a^b f(x)dx, Eq2\\) \\) Represents a definite integral (since bounds are given), and gives the area below the function \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) varies from \\((a,b)\\) in the \\(x-y\\) plane. The ability to find such areas has many applications. For example, to finding the total work done by a motor in moving a certain object, we can draw a graph of Force over time (as shown below). We have that the work \\(W=F\\times d\\) , which is the product of distance by Force . (https://pediaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/How-to-Calculate-Work-Done_Force_vs_Distance_Graph.jpg) If we assume a force by distance graph as shown above, then we see that the area above is simply the expression: \\( \\(\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) dx\\) \\) For \\(1D\\) -integrals of a function \\(f(x)\\) , the indefinite integral is equivalent to a function \\(F(x)\\) which has the unique property that \\(F'(x) = f(x) + c\\) , where \\(c\\in R\\) is some constant . This unique property is known as the fundamental theorem of calculus . By extension, any integral expression represented by Eq2 above can be written as: \\( \\(\\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)\\) \\) , since the constant terms would cancel out . Double Integrals \u00b6 After laying the framework for solving for exact areas within \\(1D\\) functions, we now attempt to extend this idea to \\(2D\\) functions. In essence, an integral of a \\(1D\\) function is an integral that solves for the exact area underneath a function \\(y=f(x)\\) across the range \\((a,b)\\) .The precise bounds of integration can be denoted using only two values, the upper and lower bounds. This is because since the input space of \\(f(x)\\) is the x-axis, the input space is a line. A subpart of a line is a line segment, which can be precisely defined by two points. However, we see that \\(2D\\) functions, unlike \\(1D\\) functions, take on \\(2\\) unknown variables. Hence, rather than a line, the input space of \\(2D\\) functions is a plane, defined by two orthonormal axes that each represent \\(1\\) unknown. Unlike the \\(1D\\) bounds of integration , the \\(2D\\) bounds of integration cannot be defined by just two values. In fact, an infinite amount is needed, since any closed contour shape on a plane can effectively be the bounds of integration for a \\(2D\\) function. (https://i.stack.imgur.com/yn8Ux.png) Above contours are all valid bounds of integration . As a result, we represent the contour usually using the symbol \\(D\\) , rather than attempt to use specific values to define it. Unlike the \\(1D\\) version, the integral of a \\(2D\\) -function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) gives the volume , not the area , of the \\(3D\\) solid that lies below the function \\(f(x,y)\\) . We can visualise the double integral of a given \\(2D\\) function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) as the sum of an infinite amount of volumes of rectangular prisms with their bases lying on the bounds of integration , which each have height given by \\(f(x,y)\\) and an infinitesimal area of the base, which has length \\(dx\\) and width \\(dy\\) . (Calculus Early Trancendentals, James Stewart) As seen above, each of the heights of the rectangular prisms is given by \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , whilst the area of the bases is given by \\(dx dy\\) . Just like the \\(1D\\) equivalent, the exact volume of the body below a 2D function is given whenever \\(dx,dy\\) approches zero , and the number of rectangular prisms we draw approach infinity . As there are more rectangular prisms, the volume we get becomes more accurate. This phenomenon is further illustrated below: (Calculus Early Trancendentals, James Stewart) To denote the exact volume, we can write the double integral . The double integral of a function \\(f(x,y)\\) over the rectangle \\(R = (a,b)\\times (c,d)\\) is represented by \\( \\(\\int_R\\int f(x,y)dA = \\lim_{m,n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\Sigma_{i=1}^m\\Sigma_{j=1}^nf(x_{ij},y_{ij})\\Delta A\\) \\) Where \\(x_{ij}\\) ranges from \\((a,c)\\) in \\(m\\) fixed intervals of length \\(\\frac{c-a}{m}\\) , while \\(y_{ij}\\) ranges from \\((b,d)\\) in \\(n\\) fixed intervals of length \\(\\frac{c-a}{n}\\) . To evaluate a double integral for the function \\(f(x,y)\\) over a rectangular region \\(D\\) , where \\(x\\) is bounded by \\((a,c)\\) and \\(y\\) is bounded by \\((b,d)\\) , we can use Fubini's theorem, which states: \\( \\(\\int_D\\int f(x,y) = \\int_a^c\\int_b^d f(x,y)dydx = \\int_b^d\\int_a^c f(x,y)dxdy\\) \\) If the integral exists. We call a function integrable if the above limit always exists and always equals to some value \\(L\\) , regardless of which sets of points \\((x_{ij},y_{ij})\\) we choose along the \\(m\\times n\\) fixed intervals. See the definition for limits in the Chapter 14 essay. Application of Double Integrals \u00b6 In \\(1D\\) calculus, the ability to solve for exact areas under a \\(1D\\) curve proved invaluable. With this ability, we were able to accurately calculate many values based on other values, such as the exact distance s at given time \\(t\\) based on velocity or even acceleration over time \\(t\\) graphs. Alternatively, we were also able to calculate solutions to finding the exact work W done by certain objects over a certain distance, when applying a variable force \\(F\\) . Similar to its \\(1D\\) counterpart, double integrals for \\(2D\\) functions allow us to solve for many different quantities. In the bottom I will list \\(3\\) examples. Areas : For a \\(2D\\) region on the \\(x-y\\) plane with contour \\(D\\) , see below for example: We say that its area is equal to the double integral: \\( \\(S = \\int_D\\int f(x,y)dxdy\\) \\) where we have \\(f(x,y)=1\\) for all points \\((x,y)\\in R^2\\) . The proof of this claim is that \\(S\\) represents the volume of the sum of the infinite rectangular prisms with base \\(dxdy\\) , lying on \\(D\\) with height \\(f(x,y)\\) . But \\(f(x,y)=1\\) for all points, so essentially this is just the volume of the prism solid with \\(D\\) as base, and extruded a height of \\(1\\) . Hence, Volume of prism solid = (Area of base) \\(\\times\\) (Height) Hence the area of \\(D\\) is equal to the double integral expression. Mass of 2D objects : Assume we have a \\(2D\\) object \\(O\\) which contains mass , and we want to find the amount of mass in \\(O\\) . We know that \\(O\\) is of the shape represented by a certain contour \\(D\\) , and at each point \\((x,y)\\) along \\(D\\) , the density (mass/unit area) is \\(p(x,y)\\) We can write the mass of \\(O\\) contributed by each infinitesimal rectangle with dimensions \\((dx,dy)\\) and position \\((x_k,y_k)\\) as the following: \\( \\(p(x_k,y_k)\\ dxdy\\) \\) Adding up all such potential rectangles that occupy the contour \\(D\\) , we have that the total mass of \\(O\\) is: \\( \\(\\int_D\\int p(x,y)\\ dxdy\\) \\) Surface area of bodies : Sometimes, it may be useful to us to find the surface area of a \\(3D\\) curve, such as the surface area of a sphere. In such a situation, what we would do is utilise double integrals. (Calculus Early Trancendentals, James Stewart) We see that, from the above diagram, to find the exact surface area of an arbitrary curved surface in \\(3D\\) we first must find the surface area of a tiny part of the curve in question, as denoted by the pink area above. We lay a few observations. 1) As \\(\\Delta x,\\Delta y\\) become small, the pink region approximates to a parallelogram tilted in 3D space(i.e. not flat, not parallel to \\(x-y\\) axis) 2) This parallelogram has two adjacent sides that can be defined by the following vectors: 1) \\(\\vec{a} = \\Delta x \\cdot i + f_x(x,y)(\\Delta x) k\\) 2) \\(\\vec{b} = \\Delta y \\cdot j + f_y(x,y)(\\Delta y) k\\) Using observation 2, we can get the surface area when \\(\\Delta x,\\Delta y\\) converges to \\((0,0)\\) approach: \\( \\(|\\vec{a}\\times \\vec{b}| = \\begin{bmatrix}i&&j&&k\\\\\\Delta x&&0&&f_x(x,y)\\Delta x\\\\0&&\\Delta y&&f_y(x,y)\\Delta y\\end{bmatrix}\\) \\) \\(=|(-f_x(x,y)\\Delta x \\Delta y) i + (-f_y(x,y)\\Delta y \\Delta x) j + (\\Delta x \\Delta y) k|\\) \\(=\\sqrt{f_x(x,y)^2 + f_y(x,y)^2 + 1}dxdy = \\sqrt{f_x(x,y)^2 + f_y(x,y)^2 + 1}dA\\) So, the total surface area of a function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , where \\((x,y)\\in D\\) , is basically the expression: \\( \\(S = \\int_D \\int \\sqrt{f_x(x,y)^2 + f_y(x,y)^2 + 1}dxdy\\) \\) Triple Integrals: \u00b6 Sometimes, we need to integrate a shape not just over two variables(ranges), but integrate over up to three variables. An example of such a situation would be when we want to find the total mass of a three dimensional region \\(D\\) , where the mass at point \\((x,y,z)\\) is defined by the function \\(k=f(x,y,z)\\) , where \\((x,y,z)\\) is within the bounds \\((a,d),(b,e),(c,g)\\) respectively: \\((a,b,c,d,e,g) \\in R\\) . For such a case, the \\(3D\\) equivalent of Fubini's theorem applies, where we have: \\( \\(\\int_D\\int\\int f(x,y,z)dV=\\int_a^d\\int_b^e\\int_c^g f(x,y,z) dzdydx\\) \\) if the limit exists. Just like for the \\(2D\\) case, the \\(3D\\) version of integration can be very useful and has many applications, such as when solving for the mass or volume of a \\(3D\\) body. It can also be used to solve for the center of mass \\((x_c,y_c,z_c)\\) of an object \\(O\\) defined on a \\(3D\\) region \\(D\\) , which can be expressed as follows: \\( \\((x_c,y_c,z_c)\\) \\) \\( \\(=(\\int_D\\int\\int xp(x,y,z)dV, \\int_D\\int\\int yp(x,y,z)dV, \\int_D\\int\\int yp(x,y,z)dV)\\) \\) Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals \u00b6 It is all and well that integrals have many real-life applications. However, sometimes the computation of certain integrals have challenges. In some cases the bounds of integration is arbitrary and hard to calculate. For \\(1D\\) calculus, we change bounds of integration through substitution as follows: \\( \\(\\int_a^b f(x)dx = \\int_c^d f(g(u))g'(u)du\\) \\) where \\((c,d)\\) is the corresponding bounds such that \\((g(c),g(d))=(a,b)\\) On occasion, the change of variables framework is also very useful in multivariable functions . For example, lets say we want to use double integrals to find the area of the green region below: (https://dcvp84mxptlac.cloudfront.net/diagrams2/CALC2-6-7-X_1.jpg) One look at the above diagram and we see that it is very difficult, nearly impossible to establish the boundary conditions with respect to \\((x,y\\) ). However, when we convert to polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\) , which are defined as: \\(r = x^2+y^2\\) \\(\\theta = arctan(\\frac{y}{x})\\) We get that the above function is very straight forward in the \\(r-\\theta\\) plane, just a function like this: Let us assume that the inner \\(r=r_0\\) , and the outer \\(r\\) is a function of \\(\\theta\\) , \\(r_o(\\theta)\\) We can easily solve for the area in the above diagram in such a case, which can be expressed as a very simple integral. \\( \\(S=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\int_{r_0}^{r_o(\\theta)} drd\\theta\\) \\) However, the problem is that the above sketched area doesn't correspond to the area of the green area above exactly. This is because, when trying to change the variables of integration to the polar coordinate system , we transformed the green region into the region sketched above . In other words, we want to find the area of the green region , but the above integral doesn't exactly calculate that. Luckily, such change of variables transformations of areas always scales each area in the original coordinate system by a certain factor, which we will attempt to find. Let us assume that we have a region of area in the original \\(x-y\\) coordinate system denoted by \\(dxdy\\) . We want to find \\(J\\) , denoted as the Jacobian , such that: \\( \\(dxdy=J\\times drd\\theta\\) \\) for all points \\((x,y)\\) . Given that: \\( \\(x(r,\\theta) = r\\cos(\\theta), y(r,\\theta) = r\\sin(\\theta)\\) \\) We have that: \\(dx = -r\\sin(\\theta)d\\theta + cos(\\theta)dr = <-r\\sin(\\theta), cos(\\theta)>\\cdot <d\\theta, dr>\\) \\(dy = r\\cos(\\theta)d\\theta + \\sin(\\theta)dr = <r\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta)>\\cdot <d\\theta, dr>\\) So, \\(dxdy\\) \\(= <-r\\sin(\\theta), cos(\\theta)>\\cdot <d\\theta, dr>\\cdot <r\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta)>\\cdot <d\\theta, dr>\\) \\(= <-r\\sin(\\theta), cos(\\theta)>\\cdot <r\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta)> \\cdot (<d\\theta, dr>)^2\\) \\(=\\begin{bmatrix}-r\\sin(\\theta) && r\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta) && \\sin(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}\\cdot (d\\theta dr)\\) \\(=rd\\theta dr\\) So, \\(dxdy = rdrd\\theta\\) . We can derive from this that the scaling factor we are looking for is \\(J\\) , represented by \\(r\\) . So, we have that the integral expression representing the green area is: \\( \\(S=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\int_{r_0}^{r_o(\\theta)} rdrd\\theta\\) \\) To extend this idea, the Jacobian of any tranformation \\(T\\) which transforms the coordinate system \\((x,y\\) ) to \\((u,v)\\) is essentially the value of the expression: \\( \\(J = \\frac{\\partial (x,y)}{\\partial (u,v)} = det(\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u}&&\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v}\\\\\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u}&&\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v}\\end{bmatrix})\\) \\) With this, we can find the double integral of any region on the \\(x-y\\) plane by tranforming it to another coordinate system represented by \\(u-v\\) plane, as long as we have \\(x=f(u,v), y=g(u,v)\\) .","title":"Chapter 15   Multiple integrals"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2015%20-%20Multiple%20integrals/#introduction","text":"In \\(1D\\) and \\(2D\\) calculus, a common problem that was encountered was solving for the exact area bounded by curves .

(https://jmahaffy.sdsu.edu/courses/f00/math122/lectures/riemann_sums/images/i_int40.gif) As shown in the above image, the sum of the green areas is an approximate answer for the actual area under the red curve . To find the exact area in \\(1D\\) calculus, we compute the integral of the function for which we want to find areas for, which is expressed as: \\( \\(\\int f(x)dx, Eq1\\) \\) for some function \\(y=f(x)\\) . The above expression represents an indefinite integral , as the bounds of integration are not defined. In general, the expression: \\( \\(\\int_a^b f(x)dx, Eq2\\) \\) Represents a definite integral (since bounds are given), and gives the area below the function \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) varies from \\((a,b)\\) in the \\(x-y\\) plane. The ability to find such areas has many applications. For example, to finding the total work done by a motor in moving a certain object, we can draw a graph of Force over time (as shown below). We have that the work \\(W=F\\times d\\) , which is the product of distance by Force . (https://pediaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/How-to-Calculate-Work-Done_Force_vs_Distance_Graph.jpg) If we assume a force by distance graph as shown above, then we see that the area above is simply the expression: \\( \\(\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) dx\\) \\) For \\(1D\\) -integrals of a function \\(f(x)\\) , the indefinite integral is equivalent to a function \\(F(x)\\) which has the unique property that \\(F'(x) = f(x) + c\\) , where \\(c\\in R\\) is some constant .

In essence, an integral of a \\(1D\\) function is an integral that solves for the exact area underneath a function \\(y=f(x)\\) across the range \\((a,b)\\) .The precise bounds of integration can be denoted using only two values, the upper and lower bounds. This is because since the input space of \\(f(x)\\) is the x-axis, the input space is a line. A subpart of a line is a line segment, which can be precisely defined by two points. However, we see that \\(2D\\) functions, unlike \\(1D\\) functions, take on \\(2\\) unknown variables. Hence, rather than a line, the input space of \\(2D\\) functions is a plane, defined by two orthonormal axes that each represent \\(1\\) unknown. Unlike the \\(1D\\) bounds of integration , the \\(2D\\) bounds of integration cannot be defined by just two values. In fact, an infinite amount is needed, since any closed contour shape on a plane can effectively be the bounds of integration for a \\(2D\\) function. (https://i.stack.imgur.com/yn8Ux.png) Above contours are all valid bounds of integration . As a result, we represent the contour usually using the symbol \\(D\\) , rather than attempt to use specific values to define it. Unlike the \\(1D\\) version, the integral of a \\(2D\\) -function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) gives the volume , not the area , of the \\(3D\\) solid that lies below the function \\(f(x,y)\\) . We can visualise the double integral of a given \\(2D\\) function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) as the sum of an infinite amount of volumes of rectangular prisms with their bases lying on the bounds of integration , which each have height given by \\(f(x,y)\\) and an infinitesimal area of the base, which has length \\(dx\\) and width \\(dy\\) . (Calculus Early Trancendentals, James Stewart) As seen above, each of the heights of the rectangular prisms is given by \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , whilst the area of the bases is given by \\(dx dy\\) . Just like the \\(1D\\) equivalent, the exact volume of the body below a 2D function is given whenever \\(dx,dy\\) approches zero , and the number of rectangular prisms we draw approach infinity . As there are more rectangular prisms, the volume we get becomes more accurate. This phenomenon is further illustrated below: (Calculus Early Trancendentals, James Stewart) To denote the exact volume, we can write the double integral . The double integral of a function \\(f(x,y)\\) over the rectangle \\(R = (a,b)\\times (c,d)\\) is represented by \\( \\(\\int_R\\int f(x,y)dA = \\lim_{m,n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\Sigma_{i=1}^m\\Sigma_{j=1}^nf(x_{ij},y_{ij})\\Delta A\\) \\) Where \\(x_{ij}\\) ranges from \\((a,c)\\) in \\(m\\) fixed intervals of length \\(\\frac{c-a}{m}\\) , while \\(y_{ij}\\) ranges from \\((b,d)\\) in \\(n\\) fixed intervals of length \\(\\frac{c-a}{n}\\) . To evaluate a double integral for the function \\(f(x,y)\\) over a rectangular region \\(D\\) , where \\(x\\) is bounded by \\((a,c)\\) and \\(y\\) is bounded by \\((b,d)\\) , we can use Fubini's theorem, which states: \\( \\(\\int_D\\int f(x,y) = \\int_a^c\\int_b^d f(x,y)dydx = \\int_b^d\\int_a^c f(x,y)dxdy\\) \\) If the integral exists. We call a function integrable if the above limit always exists and always equals to some value \\(L\\) , regardless of which sets of points \\((x_{ij},y_{ij})\\) we choose along the \\(m\\times n\\) fixed intervals.

With this ability, we were able to accurately calculate many values based on other values, such as the exact distance s at given time \\(t\\) based on velocity or even acceleration over time \\(t\\) graphs. Alternatively, we were also able to calculate solutions to finding the exact work W done by certain objects over a certain distance, when applying a variable force \\(F\\) . Similar to its \\(1D\\) counterpart, double integrals for \\(2D\\) functions allow us to solve for many different quantities. In the bottom I will list \\(3\\) examples. Areas : For a \\(2D\\) region on the \\(x-y\\) plane with contour \\(D\\) , see below for example: We say that its area is equal to the double integral: \\( \\(S = \\int_D\\int f(x,y)dxdy\\) \\) where we have \\(f(x,y)=1\\) for all points \\((x,y)\\in R^2\\) .

Mass of 2D objects : Assume we have a \\(2D\\) object \\(O\\) which contains mass , and we want to find the amount of mass in \\(O\\) . We know that \\(O\\) is of the shape represented by a certain contour \\(D\\) , and at each point \\((x,y)\\) along \\(D\\) , the density (mass/unit area) is \\(p(x,y)\\) We can write the mass of \\(O\\) contributed by each infinitesimal rectangle with dimensions \\((dx,dy)\\) and position \\((x_k,y_k)\\) as the following: \\( \\(p(x_k,y_k)\\ dxdy\\) \\) Adding up all such potential rectangles that occupy the contour \\(D\\) , we have that the total mass of \\(O\\) is: \\( \\(\\int_D\\int p(x,y)\\ dxdy\\) \\) Surface area of bodies : Sometimes, it may be useful to us to find the surface area of a \\(3D\\) curve, such as the surface area of a sphere. In such a situation, what we would do is utilise double integrals. (Calculus Early Trancendentals, James Stewart) We see that, from the above diagram, to find the exact surface area of an arbitrary curved surface in \\(3D\\) we first must find the surface area of a tiny part of the curve in question, as denoted by the pink area above. We lay a few observations. 1) As \\(\\Delta x,\\Delta y\\) become small, the pink region approximates to a parallelogram tilted in 3D space(i.e. not flat, not parallel to \\(x-y\\) axis) 2) This parallelogram has two adjacent sides that can be defined by the following vectors: 1) \\(\\vec{a} = \\Delta x \\cdot i + f_x(x,y)(\\Delta x) k\\) 2) \\(\\vec{b} = \\Delta y \\cdot j + f_y(x,y)(\\Delta y) k\\) Using observation 2, we can get the surface area when \\(\\Delta x,\\Delta y\\) converges to \\((0,0)\\) approach: \\( \\(|\\vec{a}\\times \\vec{b}| = \\begin{bmatrix}i&&j&&k\\\\\\Delta x&&0&&f_x(x,y)\\Delta x\\\\0&&\\Delta y&&f_y(x,y)\\Delta y\\end{bmatrix}\\) \\) \\(=|(-f_x(x,y)\\Delta x \\Delta y) i + (-f_y(x,y)\\Delta y \\Delta x) j + (\\Delta x \\Delta y) k|\\) \\(=\\sqrt{f_x(x,y)^2 + f_y(x,y)^2 + 1}dxdy = \\sqrt{f_x(x,y)^2 + f_y(x,y)^2 + 1}dA\\) So, the total surface area of a function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) , where \\((x,y)\\in D\\) , is basically the expression: \\( \\(S = \\int_D \\int \\sqrt{f_x(x,y)^2 + f_y(x,y)^2 + 1}dxdy\\) \\)","title":"Application of Double Integrals"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2015%20-%20Multiple%20integrals/#triple-integrals","text":"Sometimes, we need to integrate a shape not just over two variables(ranges), but integrate over up to three variables.

For example, sometimes, different people may own different things, and may have different hobbies, etc. In practice, such information is pretty hard to mathematically model. But, when such information includes both a magnitude and a direction, we can sometimes use a math tool to help us, vectors. In the 2D world, the application of such tool can be seen in the description of gradient fields of altitude curves. For example, each point on the vector field corresponds to a vector which tells of the direction of steepest ascen t, and the slope of the ascent . In the 3D world, the application of such tools can be seen in the description of certain fields, most notably the electromagnetic , gravitational , or other force fields . In such cases, for each point in the field, we can draw a vector with a magnitude and direction , representing the exact magnitude and direction of the applied force(on a specific object) at that point. Another example could be a velocity field, which shows object's velocities at different points along a \\(3D\\) space. Such fields are what we call vector fields Essentially, a vector field is any function \\(F(x,y,z)\\) that sends any point in the \\(n\\) -dimensional plane \\((x,y,z)\\) , ( \\(3D\\) is shown in this definition) within a domain \\(E\\) to an \\(n\\) dimensional vector in \\(R^n\\) For ease of understanding and analysis, one can express a vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) as the sum of its components dotted with the unit component vectors, such as \\((i,j,k)\\) . \\( \\(F(x,y,z) = P(x,y,z)i + Q(x,y,z)j + R(x,y,z)k\\) \\) A gradient vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) is any vector field that can be expressed as the gradient vector of another function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) within a certain domain, as such: \\[F(x,y,z) = \\nabla f(x,y,z)\\] If a vector field is a gradient vector field , then we say that the vector field is conservative . In this case we will call the function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) (as in the above example) as the potential function of \\(F(x,y,z)\\) . Line Integrals: \u00b6 In \\(2D\\) and \\(1D\\) , the concept of single and double integrals were used to evaluate the areas under a curve, and the volume under a planar region respectively. However, sometimes we want to evaluate integrals of a lesser dimension on a higher dimensional body. For example, for a function that takes in a \\(2D\\) input-space, instead of evaluating an integral (a infinite bounded sum) across a region of space , we want to evaluate across \\((x,y)\\) points along a customised curve \\(C\\) within the \\(2D\\) input-space. In such a situation, we must make an expression which describes the points on the \\(2D\\) space that we want to integrate over. This is done via parameterization of the customised curve \\(C\\) using a parameter \\(t\\) . Notice that if we assume we have a multidimensional function \\(F(x,y)\\) , we must parameterize the curve \\(C\\) such that it can be discreetly described as: \\( \\(x = x(t), y = y(t), A\\leq t \\leq B\\) \\) for functions \\(x(t),y(t)\\) and bounds \\(A,B\\) . With the parameterization, we integrate the function \\(F(x,y)\\) now not with respect to \\(x,y\\) , but with respect to our new variable of parameterization \\(t\\) . As we are integrating with respect to a curve now rather than a line, the unit length of the curve we are integrating over is now a variable of \\(s\\) , the arc length of the curve. We now instead have the slice being \\( \\(s = \\sqrt {x^2+y^2}\\) \\) \\( \\(ds = \\sqrt {\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dy}{dt}^2} dt\\) \\) . So we have the line integral as: \\( \\(=\\int_C F(x(t),y(t)) d\\vec{s}=\\int_C F(x(t),y(t)) \\sqrt{\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dy}{dt}^2} dt\\) \\) This effectively allows us to integrate along curves which are not strictly a line that is parallel or perpendicular to the unit axes , as in Figure 2 above. The same idea can be extended to line integration along \\(3D\\) space. This will be way harder to draw as the drawing would be in \\(4D\\) space, but basically we can write the line integral as: $$ = \\int_C F(x(t),y(t),z(t)) d\\vec{s} = \\int_C F(x,y,z)\\sqrt {\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dy}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dz}{dt}^2}dt$$ Extending the idea to multidimensional space , we have that if we write \\(r(t) = <x_1(t),x_2(t),...,x_n(t)>\\) , then the line integral is: \\( \\(=\\int_C F(r(t)) r'(t)dt\\) \\) Very similarly, if we have a continuous vector field \\(F\\) defined by the vector function \\(r(t)\\) , we must have: \\( \\(\\int_C F d\\vec{r} = \\int_a^b F(r(t))r'(t)dt\\) \\) Fundamental theorems \u00b6 The concept of conservative is important because conservative vector fields have really special properties. In essence, any line integral across a curve \\(C\\) along a conservative vector field , expressed as follows: $$\\int_C F(x,y,z) \\cdot d\\vec{r} $$ will only depend on the start and ending points of the vector field. In essence, what we can write for any conservative vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) is the following: \\( \\(\\int_C F(x,y,z) d\\vec{r} = F(x_2,y_2,z_2)-F(x_1,y_1,z_1)\\) \\) assuming that \\(C\\) is a continuous curve from point \\((x_1,y_1,z_1)\\) to \\((x_2,y_2,z_2)\\) . This property of conservative vector fields is called the independence of path . By a similar concept, any closed curve \\(C\\) (a curve which has the same start and end point) must have that: \\( \\(\\int_C F(x,y,z) d\\vec{r} = 0\\) \\) This property can be used to show independence of path , and vice versa. With conservative vector fields where \\(F(x,y) = \\nabla f(x,y)\\) and \\(F(x,y) = <P,Q>\\) , we must have that Claurinat's theorem holds, which states that: \\( \\(\\frac{dP}{dy} = \\frac{dQ}{dx}\\) \\) If we apply the ideas to a continuous force field F moving an object along a point \\(P(x,y,z)\\) in path \\(C\\) given by \\(r(t)\\) , where \\(t\\) ranges from \\((a,b)\\) , \\(r(a)=A\\) being the initial point and \\(r(b) = B\\) being the terminal point of \\(C\\) , we will have that, at any point \\(t\\) , the force is given by the following: \\( \\(F(r(t)) = m r''(t)\\) \\) By Newton's second law . We can solve for the work done by the force field on the particle, therefore, as follows: \\( \\(W=\\int_C F(r(t)) d\\vec{r} = \\int_C F(r(t))r'(t)dt\\) \\) \\( \\(\\int_C mr''(t) r'(t) = \\frac{m}{2}\\int_C \\frac{d}{dt} (r'(t))^2dt = \\frac{m (r'(b)^2-r'(a)^2)}{2}\\) \\) So we see that the work done by the conservative force field \\(F\\) is simply the difference between the expression: \\( \\(\\frac{mr'(t)^2}{2}\\) \\) evaluated at the time intervals representing the start and end . With the above information, we can write that the kinetic energy of an object can be expressed by the following equation: \\( \\(KE = \\frac{mr'(t)^2}{2} = \\frac{mv^2}{2}\\) \\) So, in other words, the work done by a force field along a curve \\(C\\) is simply the difference in kinetic energy between the endpoints of that curve \\(C\\) , or in other words, it is: \\( \\(=K(B)-K(A)\\) \\) For any conservative force field \\(F\\) , we can write \\(F=\\nabla f\\) for some \\(f(x,y,z)\\) which is continuous and differentiable along the domain of force field \\(F\\) . For such a force field, a potential energy expression \\(P\\) is a function that satisfies: \\( \\(P = -\\nabla f\\) \\) In this case, we have that work(W) is now: \\( \\(W = \\int_C F(r(t)) d\\vec{r} = -\\int_C P(r(t))r'(t) dt\\) \\) \\( \\(=P(A) - P(B)\\) \\) So we basically have: \\(K(B)-K(A) = P(A)-P(B)\\) \\(K(B)+P(B) = P(A) + K(A)\\) Essentially, we have the law of conservation of energy. With this foundation, we can now introduce Greene's Theorem . Greene's Theorem \u00b6 Given a vector field \\(F=P\\vec{i}+Q\\vec{j}\\) defined on some region \\(D\\) within the \\(xy\\) plane in \\(R^2\\) , with components \\(P,Q\\) that have continuous partial derivatives with respect to \\(x,y\\) , and a simple closed curve \\(C\\) on the \\(xy\\) plane entirely within \\(D\\) , we can write that \\( \\(\\int_C F \\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\int \\int_D (\\frac{dQ}{dx} - \\frac{dP}{dy}) dA\\) \\) Under the assumption that \\(C\\) is traversed in the positively oriented direction, the anticlockwise direction where the interior of the curve is always to the left of the curve \\(C\\) . The proof is rather complicated, but for special regions , such as regions in which the bounds of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are more explicit, the proof is rather simple. Proof of Greene's theorem for special situations WLOG, Let us assume that a region \\(D\\) can be bounded as follows, by the following expression: \\(a\\leq x \\leq b, c\\leq y \\leq d\\) Now, we have that \\( \\(\\int \\int_D \\frac{dQ}{dx}dA = \\int_a^b \\int_c^d \\frac{dQ}{dx}dydx = \\int_c^d\\int_a^b \\frac{dQ}{dx}dxdy\\) \\) \\( \\(= \\int_c^dQ(b,y)-Q(a,y)dy\\) \\) By similar logic, we can also calculate that : \\( \\(\\int \\int_D -\\frac{dP}{dy}dA = \\int_a^b \\int_c^d -\\frac{dP}{dy}dydx\\) \\) \\( \\(\\int_a^b(-P(x,d)) - (-P(x,c))dx\\) \\) Sketching a quick graph of the region \\(D\\) , we have that : We have that the line integral of any vector field \\(F\\) defined on the region \\(D\\) with continuous component partial derivatives across the boundary of \\(D\\) can essentially be broken down to the sum of the line integral of \\(F\\) along \\(C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4\\) respectively. We see that: \\( \\(\\int_{C_1} F\\cdot dr = \\int_a^b P(x, c) dx\\) \\) \\( \\(\\int_{C_3} F\\cdot dr = -\\int_a^b P(x, d) dx\\) \\) \\( \\(\\int_{C_2} F\\cdot dr = \\int_c^d Q(b, y) dy\\) \\) \\( \\(\\int_{C_4} F\\cdot dr = -\\int_c^d Q(a, y) dy\\) \\) So hence, we have that: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot dr = \\int \\int_D \\frac{dQ}{dx} - \\frac{dP}{dy}dA\\) \\) By combination and equating of the like terms within the expression. Greene's theorem makes the following situation much simpler Solving for a line integral : If a line integral is difficult to calculate, but the bounded area of the curve is easy to parameterise, then the line integral can be easily solved by the double integral. With the concept of vector fields described in detail, we can now take a look at the concept of curl and divergence Curl and Divergence \u00b6 For any given vector field \\(F = Pi + Qj + Rk\\) in 3D space , the curl of the vector field is defined as a vector that represents the cross product between the del/gradient operator \\(\\nabla\\) , and the vector field itself. In other words, the curl of a vector field is described by the following: \\( \\(curl (F) = \\begin{bmatrix}i&&j&&k\\\\\\frac{d}{dx}&&\\frac{d}{dy}&&\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\P&&Q&&R\\end{bmatrix}\\) \\) Essentially, the curl of a vector field \\(F\\) has the geometric meaning of representing the magnitude and (axial) direction to which a vector field rotates. In a sense, at a point \\((x,y,z)\\) defined on the vector field \\(F\\) , the direction of the curl vector tells you the exact axis by which the vector field will rotate the point (counterclockwise when looking from the top of the axis). Essentially, if you were to take an infinitesimally sized 3D cube at the point \\((x,y,z)\\) and leave it in a force field with magnitudes and directions at all points governed by \\(F\\) , the direction of the curl tells you the direction in which the cube will rotate, anticlockwisely, and the magnitude of the curl tells you the extent of the rotation, sort of like an analog to the rotational speed. Similarly, for any given point \\((x,y,z)\\) on the vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) , the divergence is a scalar quantity that represents the dot product between the del/gradient operator \\(\\nabla\\) , and the vector field itself. It is denoted by the expression: \\( \\(divergence(F) = \\frac{dP}{dx} + \\frac{dQ}{dy}+\\frac{dR}{dz}\\) \\) This quantity expresses the extent to which the vector field flows in or out of the point. Essentially, if a vector field flows out of a point more than it flows in,then we say the point has positive divergence , and vice versa. Curl and Divergence are very useful concepts because they introduce operations that tell us more about an unknown 3D vector space than we previously would've known using just the gradient operator \\(\\nabla\\) itself. The curl parameter tells us about useful things such as the net shear on each axis at every given point caused by the vector field, whilst the divergence tells us, if the vector field is describing the motion of some body, how much new stuff (be it mass, energy or something) is being created by the vector field. With these concepts defined, we can rewrite Greene's theorem by introducing the Greene's theorem's vector field \\(F\\) slightly differently. Instead of writing \\(F\\) as a 2D vector field \\(Pi + Qj\\) , we will now artificially make it a 3D vector field by writing \\(F\\) as \\(Pi + Qj + 0k\\) . Now we can compute the curl of F. \\( \\(curl F = \\begin{bmatrix}i&&j&&k\\\\\\frac{d}{dx}&&\\frac{d}{dy}&&\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\P&&Q&&0\\end{bmatrix}=(\\frac{dQ}{dx} - \\frac{dP}{dy})\\vec{k}\\) \\) This is because the partial derivatives of \\(P,Q\\) relative to \\(z\\) are both zero since they are functions of \\(x,y\\) , and the partial derivative of \\(0\\) relative to anything is obviously zero. Notice this is exactly the expression on the right-hand side of Greene's theorem. So we can write that \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot dr = \\int\\int_D (curl F)\\cdot \\vec{k} dA\\) \\) Which is the new version of Greene's . If we instead decided to multiply the vector field \\(F\\) by the normal vector of \\(dr\\) (of unit length \\(dr\\) ), then we would get: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot n ds = \\int \\int_D (div F)dA\\) \\) , meaning the product of \\(F\\) with the unit normal component of \\(dr\\) integrated along the line curve \\(C\\) is actually just the double integral of the divergence of \\(F\\) along the region \\(D\\) . Other useful facts about curl and divergence are : 1. Divergence of a curl of any vector field is always zero 2. Curl of a conservative vector field is always zero. 3. If the curl of a vector field is zero at every point, then the vector field must be conservative Just like how we can parameterize a \\(1D\\) curve living in \\(2D\\) or even \\(3D\\) via a parameter \\(t\\) which is allowed to change and move around, we can also parameterize a \\(2D\\) plane in \\(3D\\) , enabling us to make calculations such as surface integrals easier. In general, let us define a plane with axis \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) . Now, let us define a surface \\(S\\) in 3D relative to the points \\(u,v\\) , as follows: \\( \\(S = (x(u,v), y(u,v),z(u,v)), a\\leq u \\leq b, c\\leq v\\leq d\\) \\) We see that this is effectively a 1-1 correspondence between points on the \\(uv\\) plane within the domain. In essence, this allows us to represent many surfaces in 3D , since the points on a plane often depend on not just 1, but 2 variables. For example, the top plane is the rotation of the curve \\(y=\\sin(x)\\) across the \\(x\\) plane, and its parameterization can be expressed relative to two variables: \\((x, \\theta)\\) \\( \\(x = x, y = \\sin(x)\\times \\cos(\\theta), z = \\sin(x) \\times \\sin(\\theta)\\) \\) Where \\(\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi)\\) We see that, for a surface \\(S\\) in the 3D plane parameterized by the variables \\(u,v\\) , as follows: \\( \\(S = (x(u,v), y(u,v),z(u,v))\\) \\) To get the surface area of the parameterized curve that corresponds to a certain region of parameterization \\(D\\) in the uv plane, we must first find the unit change in surface area of \\(S\\) , \\(dS\\) , with respect to the unit changes in area of the corresponding region in \\(uv\\) plane, \\(du\\times dv\\) . We see that, if we assume \\(du, dv\\) to be infinitesimal (that is, incredibly small), then \\(dS\\) is also an infintesimal region that is made up of two vector components, \\(r_u, r_v\\) , where \\(r_u, r_v\\) are the partial derivatives of each component of \\(S\\) relative to \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) respectively. Assuming the region \\(dS\\) is infinitesimal , we can approximate \\(dS\\) (represented by the blue surface above), as exactly the cross product of the partial derivatives of the components of \\(S\\) relative to \\(u, v\\) evaluated at the respected point \\(u,v\\) , as such: \\(dS = |\\vec{r_u} \\times \\vec{r_v}|dA = |\\vec{r_u} \\times \\vec{r_v}|dudv\\) So, we effectively have that: Surface Area of parameterized region \\(S\\) \\( \\(= \\int\\int dS = \\int\\int|\\vec{r_u} \\times \\vec{r_v}|dudv\\) \\) , where \\(r_u = <\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u},\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u}>, r_v = <\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v},\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial v}>\\) For surfaces expressed as multivariable functions, such as surfaces represented by the function: \\(z = f(x,y)\\) , we have that the entire surface is already parameterized by variables \\((x,y)\\) , so: \\(r_x = <1, 0, f_x>, r_y = <0,1,f_y>\\) , and therefore: Surface Area of multivariable function: \\( \\(=\\int\\int |\\vec{r_x}\\times \\vec{r_y}| dxdy = \\int\\int \\sqrt{(f_x)^2 + (f_y)^2 + 1}dxdy\\) \\) Now we are ready to introduce an extended version of Greene's theorem, Stokes theorem . We have discovered previously that Greene's theorem, if extended into 3D , can be written as follows: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot dr = \\int\\int_D (curl F)\\cdot \\vec{k} dA\\) \\) Where \\(C\\) is a curve in a 2D plane, and \\(D\\) is a region in \\(xy\\) space, with normal vector \\(k\\) . It turns out, however, that this idea can also be extended into 3D . If we instead let \\(C\\) be any closed curve in \\(3D\\) space, and let \\(D\\) be the region enclosed by \\(C\\) , and we suppose that \\(F\\) is a vector field in \\(3D\\) defined on the entirety of the region \\(D\\) , and we let \\(n(x,y,z)\\) be the unit normal vector to the surface \\(D\\) at any point \\((x,y,z)\\) on \\(D\\) , then we can write the following: Stokes theorem: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\int\\int_D (curl F)\\cdot \\vec{n} dA = \\int\\int_D (curlF) \\cdot d\\vec{S}\\) \\) It turns out the equivalent of Greene's theorem in 3D also is a true statement! With this, it is obvious that Greene's theorem is just a very special case of Stokes theorem, whereby the region \\(D\\) is entirely horizontal and orthogonal to the \\(z\\) axis at every point. AMAZING! We can now also introduce the divergence theorem . Remember that another analog to Greene's theorem can be written as follows: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot \\vec{n} ds = \\int\\int_D div(F(x,y)) dA\\) \\) Which essentially is telling us that the dot product between a vector field \\(F\\) with continuous component partial derivatives integrated along a closed boundary curve \\(C\\) is equal to the divergence of the vector field integrated across the region \\(D\\) in the \\(xy\\) plane enclosed by \\(C\\) . If we were to hope to extend this to the 3rd dimension, we would effectively seek to be enclosing a \\(3D\\) -region \\(D\\) via a surface \\(S\\) . So, our 3D analog would be: \\( \\(\\int\\int_S F\\cdot \\vec{n} dS = \\int\\int\\int_D div(F(x,y,z)) dA\\) \\) In fact, this equation above, called the divergence theorem , is true under certain constraints. Firstly, we see that \\(\\vec{n}\\) has to be postively oriented, which just means that \\(\\vec{n}\\) must point away from the surface itself(see below image): Secondly, \\(F\\) obviously must have components that each have continuous partial derivatives relative to the axes \\(x,y,z\\) . within the region defined by \\(D\\) , as well as the boundary curve \\(C\\) . Effectively, what this theorem tells us is that, regardless of whether the reference is in \\(2D\\) or \\(3D\\) , the total divergence(flux) of a vector field \\(F\\) within a region \\(D\\) is simply the sum of the divergences at the boundary. With this, we have concluded the analysis of vectors.","title":"Chapter 16   Vector Fields"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2016%20-%20Vector%20Fields/#introduction","text":"Information is all around us. For example, sometimes, different people may own different things, and may have different hobbies, etc. In practice, such information is pretty hard to mathematically model. But, when such information includes both a magnitude and a direction, we can sometimes use a math tool to help us, vectors. In the 2D world, the application of such tool can be seen in the description of gradient fields of altitude curves. For example, each point on the vector field corresponds to a vector which tells of the direction of steepest ascen t, and the slope of the ascent . In the 3D world, the application of such tools can be seen in the description of certain fields, most notably the electromagnetic , gravitational , or other force fields . In such cases, for each point in the field, we can draw a vector with a magnitude and direction , representing the exact magnitude and direction of the applied force(on a specific object) at that point. Another example could be a velocity field, which shows object's velocities at different points along a \\(3D\\) space. Such fields are what we call vector fields Essentially, a vector field is any function \\(F(x,y,z)\\) that sends any point in the \\(n\\) -dimensional plane \\((x,y,z)\\) , ( \\(3D\\) is shown in this definition) within a domain \\(E\\) to an \\(n\\) dimensional vector in \\(R^n\\) For ease of understanding and analysis, one can express a vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) as the sum of its components dotted with the unit component vectors, such as \\((i,j,k)\\) . \\( \\(F(x,y,z) = P(x,y,z)i + Q(x,y,z)j + R(x,y,z)k\\) \\) A gradient vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) is any vector field that can be expressed as the gradient vector of another function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) within a certain domain, as such: \\[F(x,y,z) = \\nabla f(x,y,z)\\] If a vector field is a gradient vector field , then we say that the vector field is conservative . In this case we will call the function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) (as in the above example) as the potential function of \\(F(x,y,z)\\) .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2016%20-%20Vector%20Fields/#line-integrals","text":"In \\(2D\\) and \\(1D\\) , the concept of single and double integrals were used to evaluate the areas under a curve, and the volume under a planar region respectively. However, sometimes we want to evaluate integrals of a lesser dimension on a higher dimensional body. For example, for a function that takes in a \\(2D\\) input-space, instead of evaluating an integral (a infinite bounded sum) across a region of space , we want to evaluate across \\((x,y)\\) points along a customised curve \\(C\\) within the \\(2D\\) input-space. In such a situation, we must make an expression which describes the points on the \\(2D\\) space that we want to integrate over. This is done via parameterization of the customised curve \\(C\\) using a parameter \\(t\\) . Notice that if we assume we have a multidimensional function \\(F(x,y)\\) , we must parameterize the curve \\(C\\) such that it can be discreetly described as: \\( \\(x = x(t), y = y(t), A\\leq t \\leq B\\) \\) for functions \\(x(t),y(t)\\) and bounds \\(A,B\\) . With the parameterization, we integrate the function \\(F(x,y)\\) now not with respect to \\(x,y\\) , but with respect to our new variable of parameterization \\(t\\) . As we are integrating with respect to a curve now rather than a line, the unit length of the curve we are integrating over is now a variable of \\(s\\) , the arc length of the curve. We now instead have the slice being \\( \\(s = \\sqrt {x^2+y^2}\\) \\) \\( \\(ds = \\sqrt {\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dy}{dt}^2} dt\\) \\) . So we have the line integral as: \\( \\(=\\int_C F(x(t),y(t)) d\\vec{s}=\\int_C F(x(t),y(t)) \\sqrt{\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dy}{dt}^2} dt\\) \\) This effectively allows us to integrate along curves which are not strictly a line that is parallel or perpendicular to the unit axes , as in Figure 2 above. The same idea can be extended to line integration along \\(3D\\) space. This will be way harder to draw as the drawing would be in \\(4D\\) space, but basically we can write the line integral as: $$ = \\int_C F(x(t),y(t),z(t)) d\\vec{s} = \\int_C F(x,y,z)\\sqrt {\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dy}{dt}^2 + \\frac{dz}{dt}^2}dt$$ Extending the idea to multidimensional space , we have that if we write \\(r(t) = <x_1(t),x_2(t),...,x_n(t)>\\) , then the line integral is: \\( \\(=\\int_C F(r(t)) r'(t)dt\\) \\) Very similarly, if we have a continuous vector field \\(F\\) defined by the vector function \\(r(t)\\) , we must have: \\( \\(\\int_C F d\\vec{r} = \\int_a^b F(r(t))r'(t)dt\\) \\)","title":"Line Integrals:"},{"location":"MAFF/Chapter%2016%20-%20Vector%20Fields/#fundamental-theorems","text":"The concept of conservative is important because conservative vector fields have really special properties. In essence, any line integral across a curve \\(C\\) along a conservative vector field , expressed as follows: $$\\int_C F(x,y,z) \\cdot d\\vec{r} $$ will only depend on the start and ending points of the vector field. In essence, what we can write for any conservative vector field \\(F(x,y,z)\\) is the following: \\( \\(\\int_C F(x,y,z) d\\vec{r} = F(x_2,y_2,z_2)-F(x_1,y_1,z_1)\\) \\) assuming that \\(C\\) is a continuous curve from point \\((x_1,y_1,z_1)\\) to \\((x_2,y_2,z_2)\\) . This property of conservative vector fields is called the independence of path . By a similar concept, any closed curve \\(C\\) (a curve which has the same start and end point) must have that: \\( \\(\\int_C F(x,y,z) d\\vec{r} = 0\\) \\) This property can be used to show independence of path , and vice versa. With conservative vector fields where \\(F(x,y) = \\nabla f(x,y)\\) and \\(F(x,y) = <P,Q>\\) , we must have that Claurinat's theorem holds, which states that: \\( \\(\\frac{dP}{dy} = \\frac{dQ}{dx}\\) \\) If we apply the ideas to a continuous force field F moving an object along a point \\(P(x,y,z)\\) in path \\(C\\) given by \\(r(t)\\) , where \\(t\\) ranges from \\((a,b)\\) , \\(r(a)=A\\) being the initial point and \\(r(b) = B\\) being the terminal point of \\(C\\) , we will have that, at any point \\(t\\) , the force is given by the following: \\( \\(F(r(t)) = m r''(t)\\) \\) By Newton's second law . We can solve for the work done by the force field on the particle, therefore, as follows: \\( \\(W=\\int_C F(r(t)) d\\vec{r} = \\int_C F(r(t))r'(t)dt\\) \\) \\( \\(\\int_C mr''(t) r'(t) = \\frac{m}{2}\\int_C \\frac{d}{dt} (r'(t))^2dt = \\frac{m (r'(b)^2-r'(a)^2)}{2}\\) \\) So we see that the work done by the conservative force field \\(F\\) is simply the difference between the expression: \\( \\(\\frac{mr'(t)^2}{2}\\) \\) evaluated at the time intervals representing the start and end . With the above information, we can write that the kinetic energy of an object can be expressed by the following equation: \\( \\(KE = \\frac{mr'(t)^2}{2} = \\frac{mv^2}{2}\\) \\) So, in other words, the work done by a force field along a curve \\(C\\) is simply the difference in kinetic energy between the endpoints of that curve \\(C\\) , or in other words, it is: \\( \\(=K(B)-K(A)\\) \\) For any conservative force field \\(F\\) , we can write \\(F=\\nabla f\\) for some \\(f(x,y,z)\\) which is continuous and differentiable along the domain of force field \\(F\\) .

Now we can compute the curl of F. \\( \\(curl F = \\begin{bmatrix}i&&j&&k\\\\\\frac{d}{dx}&&\\frac{d}{dy}&&\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\P&&Q&&0\\end{bmatrix}=(\\frac{dQ}{dx} - \\frac{dP}{dy})\\vec{k}\\) \\) This is because the partial derivatives of \\(P,Q\\) relative to \\(z\\) are both zero since they are functions of \\(x,y\\) , and the partial derivative of \\(0\\) relative to anything is obviously zero. Notice this is exactly the expression on the right-hand side of Greene's theorem. So we can write that \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot dr = \\int\\int_D (curl F)\\cdot \\vec{k} dA\\) \\) Which is the new version of Greene's . If we instead decided to multiply the vector field \\(F\\) by the normal vector of \\(dr\\) (of unit length \\(dr\\) ), then we would get: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot n ds = \\int \\int_D (div F)dA\\) \\) , meaning the product of \\(F\\) with the unit normal component of \\(dr\\) integrated along the line curve \\(C\\) is actually just the double integral of the divergence of \\(F\\) along the region \\(D\\) . Other useful facts about curl and divergence are : 1. Divergence of a curl of any vector field is always zero 2. Curl of a conservative vector field is always zero. 3. If the curl of a vector field is zero at every point, then the vector field must be conservative Just like how we can parameterize a \\(1D\\) curve living in \\(2D\\) or even \\(3D\\) via a parameter \\(t\\) which is allowed to change and move around, we can also parameterize a \\(2D\\) plane in \\(3D\\) , enabling us to make calculations such as surface integrals easier. In general, let us define a plane with axis \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) . Now, let us define a surface \\(S\\) in 3D relative to the points \\(u,v\\) , as follows: \\( \\(S = (x(u,v), y(u,v),z(u,v)), a\\leq u \\leq b, c\\leq v\\leq d\\) \\) We see that this is effectively a 1-1 correspondence between points on the \\(uv\\) plane within the domain. In essence, this allows us to represent many surfaces in 3D , since the points on a plane often depend on not just 1, but 2 variables. For example, the top plane is the rotation of the curve \\(y=\\sin(x)\\) across the \\(x\\) plane, and its parameterization can be expressed relative to two variables: \\((x, \\theta)\\) \\( \\(x = x, y = \\sin(x)\\times \\cos(\\theta), z = \\sin(x) \\times \\sin(\\theta)\\) \\) Where \\(\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi)\\) We see that, for a surface \\(S\\) in the 3D plane parameterized by the variables \\(u,v\\) , as follows: \\( \\(S = (x(u,v), y(u,v),z(u,v))\\) \\) To get the surface area of the parameterized curve that corresponds to a certain region of parameterization \\(D\\) in the uv plane, we must first find the unit change in surface area of \\(S\\) , \\(dS\\) , with respect to the unit changes in area of the corresponding region in \\(uv\\) plane, \\(du\\times dv\\) . We see that, if we assume \\(du, dv\\) to be infinitesimal (that is, incredibly small), then \\(dS\\) is also an infintesimal region that is made up of two vector components, \\(r_u, r_v\\) , where \\(r_u, r_v\\) are the partial derivatives of each component of \\(S\\) relative to \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) respectively. Assuming the region \\(dS\\) is infinitesimal , we can approximate \\(dS\\) (represented by the blue surface above), as exactly the cross product of the partial derivatives of the components of \\(S\\) relative to \\(u, v\\) evaluated at the respected point \\(u,v\\) , as such: \\(dS = |\\vec{r_u} \\times \\vec{r_v}|dA = |\\vec{r_u} \\times \\vec{r_v}|dudv\\) So, we effectively have that: Surface Area of parameterized region \\(S\\) \\( \\(= \\int\\int dS = \\int\\int|\\vec{r_u} \\times \\vec{r_v}|dudv\\) \\) , where \\(r_u = <\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u},\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u}>, r_v = <\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v},\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial v}>\\) For surfaces expressed as multivariable functions, such as surfaces represented by the function: \\(z = f(x,y)\\) , we have that the entire surface is already parameterized by variables \\((x,y)\\) , so: \\(r_x = <1, 0, f_x>, r_y = <0,1,f_y>\\) , and therefore: Surface Area of multivariable function: \\( \\(=\\int\\int |\\vec{r_x}\\times \\vec{r_y}| dxdy = \\int\\int \\sqrt{(f_x)^2 + (f_y)^2 + 1}dxdy\\) \\) Now we are ready to introduce an extended version of Greene's theorem, Stokes theorem . We have discovered previously that Greene's theorem, if extended into 3D , can be written as follows: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot dr = \\int\\int_D (curl F)\\cdot \\vec{k} dA\\) \\) Where \\(C\\) is a curve in a 2D plane, and \\(D\\) is a region in \\(xy\\) space, with normal vector \\(k\\) . It turns out, however, that this idea can also be extended into 3D . If we instead let \\(C\\) be any closed curve in \\(3D\\) space, and let \\(D\\) be the region enclosed by \\(C\\) , and we suppose that \\(F\\) is a vector field in \\(3D\\) defined on the entirety of the region \\(D\\) , and we let \\(n(x,y,z)\\) be the unit normal vector to the surface \\(D\\) at any point \\((x,y,z)\\) on \\(D\\) , then we can write the following: Stokes theorem: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\int\\int_D (curl F)\\cdot \\vec{n} dA = \\int\\int_D (curlF) \\cdot d\\vec{S}\\) \\) It turns out the equivalent of Greene's theorem in 3D also is a true statement! With this, it is obvious that Greene's theorem is just a very special case of Stokes theorem, whereby the region \\(D\\) is entirely horizontal and orthogonal to the \\(z\\) axis at every point. AMAZING! We can now also introduce the divergence theorem . Remember that another analog to Greene's theorem can be written as follows: \\( \\(\\int_C F\\cdot \\vec{n} ds = \\int\\int_D div(F(x,y)) dA\\) \\) Which essentially is telling us that the dot product between a vector field \\(F\\) with continuous component partial derivatives integrated along a closed boundary curve \\(C\\) is equal to the divergence of the vector field integrated across the region \\(D\\) in the \\(xy\\) plane enclosed by \\(C\\) . If we were to hope to extend this to the 3rd dimension, we would effectively seek to be enclosing a \\(3D\\) -region \\(D\\) via a surface \\(S\\) . So, our 3D analog would be: \\( \\(\\int\\int_S F\\cdot \\vec{n} dS = \\int\\int\\int_D div(F(x,y,z)) dA\\) \\) In fact, this equation above, called the divergence theorem , is true under certain constraints. Firstly, we see that \\(\\vec{n}\\) has to be postively oriented, which just means that \\(\\vec{n}\\) must point away from the surface itself(see below image): Secondly, \\(F\\) obviously must have components that each have continuous partial derivatives relative to the axes \\(x,y,z\\) . within the region defined by \\(D\\) , as well as the boundary curve \\(C\\) . Effectively, what this theorem tells us is that, regardless of whether the reference is in \\(2D\\) or \\(3D\\) , the total divergence(flux) of a vector field \\(F\\) within a region \\(D\\) is simply the sum of the divergences at the boundary. With this, we have concluded the analysis of vectors.","title":"Curl and Divergence"},{"location":"MAFF/Cool%20math%20theorems/","text":"Divergence of product of two functions \\(f, g\\) \\(= div(f\\cdot g) = f div(g) + g div(f)\\) Divergence of curl of function: \\(= div(curl f) = 0\\) Curl of conservative vector field: \\(= curl (F) = 0\\) For incompressible fluid flow, we must have \\(div(F) = 0\\) The curl of a vector field is a vector field .

QNH: Local pressure at (for example) the airport of departure QNH - The pressure set on the subscale of the altimeter so that the instrument indicates its height above sea level . So basically since the earth has different air pressures at different points, we see that the QNH would be slightly different at different airports. We don't need to know the reference pressure at all times. Air Traffic Control(ATC): Basically everytime aircraft gets close to an altitutde, they always get a QNH Hectopascal = 10^2 pascal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-ZRCupN2Ps However, altitude during flight is also somewhat important to know, since two aircraft could be exactly the same altitude and risk hitting into each other but not know, due to the difference in QNH of the starting airports. Solution: Above a fixed transition altitude , all aircraft will set the same QNH so that the vertical separation will be guaranteed between two aircraft. This transition altitude is 20,000 feet. Above that, all altimeterss set their QNH to the standard, which is 1013hPa A transition altitude is where you set the altimeter to standard when climbing. A transition LEVEL , on the other hand, is the lowest altitude you may fly in cruise using the STD altimeter setting. In other words, QNH is specific to each location and each point, which will give you exact height above ground. Flight Level, when put into altimeter, will give you difference in height Synchronus Signal A signal is in sync with another signal.","title":"Important facts"},{"location":"STAR/LE2%20board%20enclosure%20building/","text":"PCB Board thickness: Standard : 1.57mm or 0.062in","title":"LE2 board enclosure building"},{"location":"STAR/Measurements/","text":"start = 3.925 for i in range(7): print(start) start += 1.375 3.925 in for the first periphrial board 5.3 in for second periphrial board 6.675 in for third periphrial board 8.05 in for fourth periphrial board 9.425 in for fifth periphrial board 10.8 in for sixth periphrial board 12.175 in for seventh periphrial board Distance between each subsequent periphrial boards: 1.375 in Board width: 0.575 in","title":"Measurements"},{"location":"STAR/Namespace/","text":"Cool stuff","title":"Namespace"},{"location":"STAR/Notes%20KICAD/","text":"","title":"Notes KICAD"},{"location":"STAR/SIL/","text":"https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/bst-bmp390l-ds001.pdf datasheet Bmp390 A capacitor is a passive , passive means any part that isn't controlled by a microcontroller","title":"SIL"},{"location":"Topic%201/Note%201/","text":"Note 1 \u00b6 Example: link to [[Mermaid Diagrams]] under Features","title":"Note 1"},{"location":"Topic%201/Note%201/#note-1","text":"Example: link to [[Mermaid Diagrams]] under Features","title":"Note 1"},{"location":"Topic%201/Note%202/","text":"Note 2 \u00b6","title":"Note 2"},{"location":"Topic%201/Note%202/#note-2","text":"","title":"Note 2"},{"location":"meta/templates/Done%20Status/","text":"DONE","title":"Done Status"},{"location":"meta/templates/To%20Do%20List%20Template/","text":"Today is a great day, it is a gift Daily To-Do List | To do list | Priority | Completion Status | | ---------- | -------- | ----------------- | | | | |","title":"To Do List Template"},{"location":"meta/templates/discussion_template/","text":"r/discussion \u00b6 Discussion notes: link Discussion __ / \u00b6 print(\"Hello world i am so incredibly cool\")","title":"Discussion template"},{"location":"meta/templates/discussion_template/#rdiscussion","text":"Discussion notes: link","title":"r/discussion"},{"location":"meta/templates/discussion_template/#discussion-__","text":"print(\"Hello world i am so incredibly cool\")","title":"Discussion __ /"},{"location":"meta/templates/lecture_template/","text":"r/lecture \u00b6 Lecture notes: link Lecture: / \u00b6 print(\"Hello world i am cool\")","title":"Lecture template"},{"location":"meta/templates/lecture_template/#rlecture","text":"Lecture notes: link","title":"r/lecture"},{"location":"meta/templates/lecture_template/#lecture","text":"print(\"Hello world i am cool\")","title":"Lecture: /"},{"location":"meta/templates/matrix/","text":"\\begin{bmatrix}\\end{bmatrix}","title":"Matrix"},{"location":"meta/templates/not%20done%20status/","text":"NOT DONE","title":"Not done status"},{"location":"meta/templates/partials/","text":"\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}","title":"Partials"}]}
