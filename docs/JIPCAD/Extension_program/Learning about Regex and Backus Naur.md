![[chrome_sX1A7fTgeU.png]]
Similarly, regular expression cannot describe set of valid regular expression!

### Grammar
A language has:
- **Syntax** set of allowed expressions in a language
- **Semantics:** meaning of an expression

A *grammar* is a compact description of the syntax of a langauge

A *regular language* is a language whose syntax can be described by a regular expression
	E.g. Brainfuck
A *context free language* has syntax that can be described by a **context free grammar**

- Has all the features of a regular expression
- Can ensure that parenthesis are balanced and properly nested

# Backus-Naur Form
A particular syntax for describing context-free grammars
- Something like it was invented by John Backus Naur 
- Describing languages via context-free grammar
