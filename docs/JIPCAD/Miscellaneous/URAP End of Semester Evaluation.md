**Please describe what you did in your apprenticeship this term. What were your assignments? What did you learn? Some projects may still have been remote, please also address if and how this format affected your work. Please elaborate in two or three paragraphs.**
During the apprenticeship, I helped to develop and further improve the Berkeley JIPCAD project, essentially building a 3D-modeling tool that uses code, rather than 3D perspective tools like Solidworks, to sketch 3D bodies. Essentially, this was like a graphics API. 

During the project, my assignments assigned to me by the professor was mainly just to understand the relevant software and learn to draw some things on it. 

I learnt a lot about the new programming language itself, and how to use it to sketch points, rotated shapes and much more. I also had a better understanding of how CAD tools like solidworks work, and the comparative advantage of the JIPCAD project over conventional tools like Solidworks, the most obvious being the way JIPCAD can sketch bodies with weird topologies, such as the mobius strip. I also learnt a lot during my development of a VSCode extension for JIPCAD, where I learnt a lot about compilers, base-level programming languages like antlr4, and how to write a grammar for a new programming language.

The remote project format was a tad bit unideal in my opinion, and I believe it would've been better for learning if meetings could've been face to face. On the bright side though, I'm not complaining since the remote project format also gave me more free time, since I don't have to commute anywhere. 

**Who supervised your apprenticeship? Please describe your interactions with your faculty mentor and any others who guided you through your apprenticeship this term. Did you have regular group/individual meetings, in person or on zoom? How did you stay in contact?**
Prof. Carlo Sequin supervised my apprenticeship, as we had regular group meetings on a weekly basis. Occasionally we even had more than one weekly meeting. Prof. Sequin was also very active in answering any emails containing questions that I had regarding the software. I would email him directly, and he would often reply promptly. Other than that, we haven't stayed in contact in other ways. I have never met my supervisors in person. There are also many experienced members in the team(people who already have been in the project for many years), such as Monica Tang. She, along with others, also helped answer many questions that we had about the software. 

**How could your experience with your specific project (and mentor) have been improved?**
I think if there was a more concrete / developed guide written on the JIPCAD website / documentation, that would have helped with the experience significantly. It took me a lot of time to only somewhat understand how the professors' team's software works, and the guidance provided at the start could've been much better.  I feel the professor and his experienced team could've helped newcomers more with explanations and some homework possibly. I hope that next semester I can help to improve the experience by improving the website. 

**Please evaluate your experience with the URAP program (administration, the online information, and the application process).**
It was pretty easy and pretty chill. I had a lot of fun, learnt a lot, and it was pretty nice. I think it would be better if professors would meet up with apprentice students 1-1, however, and I think that would definitely faciliate better learning experience. 


**Think back to the expectations that you had when you applied to this specific project. To what extent has your experience on this project met your expectations?**

My goals for this URAP project was to 
A. Learn new things
B. Contribute to project

I have achieved A as I learnt a lot about the project, as well as gained better understanding of how CAD software work at the base level. I also learnt a lot of math such as Frenet frames and whatnot.

I have achieved B as in the short timespan of being a part of this URAP project; I have successfully and independently developed a VSCode extension (essentially an integrated development environment) for the language that is used for this project. Albeit, the extension has limited functionalities as of yet, but still I have contributed, made other people's lives easier in the team.
