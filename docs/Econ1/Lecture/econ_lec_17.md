# Has the Fed succceeded in hitting the Inflation target?
Annual changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures

HOw will Fed likely respond if output gap becomes more positive and inflation  rate moves above target:
- Reduce interest rate

# Why not target zero inflation?
The Fed does not target zero inflation because
1. inflation greases the wheels of the labor market
	2. 
2. The FED can lower real interest rates when inflation is above zero.
3. A 0% inflation target runs the risk of deflation
4. Measured inflation may be overstated.

Employees are very unwilling to get nominal wage cuts. 

If prices are falling, then businesses anticipate the economy to be bad(less prices for their goods and services), and therefore they are reluctant to invest and continue growing. This sustains a deflationary spiral, lwo inflation causes a reluctancy in businesses to invest, consumers to spend, etc.... This then creates **deflationary spiral**

# Federal Funds rate
The **federal funds rate** is the interest rate that the Fed uses as its policy tool, which is the nominal interest rate that banks borrow from each other overnight in the federal funds market.

Targeting the interest rates the banks use to exchange money with each other. 

**How Monetary Policy decisions are Implemented**
- The Fed does not directly set the federal funds rate
- The FOMC creates incentives for banks that shift the supply or demand for loans in the market.

# Tool One: Interest on Excess Reserves

To influence the federal funds rate, the Fed pays interest to banks on their excess reserves

# Tool Two: Overnight Borrowing by the Fed

The fed borrows money overnight from financial institutionts to increase the demand for overnight loans, which leads to higher interest rates.
The Fed has the power to create new money. Bank accounts have to raise money 

The banks were lent money at very steep interest rates during the crash of the 2008. Big bank managers were all fired for lending too much money to peole.

# Tool Four: Buying and Selling Government Bonds
The Fed buys and sells government bonds.

This leads to the three Ts of fiscal policy: It must be timely, targeted, and temporary. Timely refers to the idea that policy makers must act quickly, getting ahead of looming problems. Targeted refers to the idea that fiscal policy—unlike monetary policy—can focus on the specific regions, industries, and groups of workers who need the most help. Fiscal stimulus is more likely to be effective when it’s targeted in a way that gets money in the hands of those who are more likely to spend it. (By contrast, sending money to people who are going to save it or pay off existing debt won’t raise spending and hence won’t boost GDP.) Finally, temporary refers to the idea that extra spending is no longer required when the economy has recovered. Indeed, as we’re about to see, were a rise in government spending to persist, it risks reducing private investment.
