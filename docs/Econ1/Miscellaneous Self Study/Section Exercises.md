**Scale Effect:** 
When the price of capital goods (or any of your inputs) declines, your business can produce output more cheaply, so at a given price, you will sell a larger quantity. That is, you’ll produce at a larger scale, which may require more workers, increasing your business’s labor demand.

**Substitution Effect:**
There are many tasks that can be done by either workers or machines. And so when the price of these machines falls, the demand for workers to do tasks that can be substituted for machines decreases.

If **the scale effect** dominates then labor and capital are complements, so a decrease in the price of capital will lead to a rightward shift of the labor demand curve. If **the substitution effect** dominates then labor and capital are substitutes, so a decrease in the price of capital will lead to a leftward shift of the labor demand curve.

6a. This will either increase the demand for labour or decrease the demand for labor. By the substitution effect, we see that the demand for labor by GM will decrease, since less workers are needed as more of the labour can be substituted for by technology. By the scale effect, the demand for labor by GM will increase, since more advances in technology will lead to greater productivity, which will then require more demand for labor. If the substitution effect dominates, then there will be less demand for labor. On the other hand, if the scale effect dominates, then there will be a greater demand for labor. 

6b. Then more productive the workers are, the likelier it will be that there with be more revenue for the firms to make. With more revenue, the scale effect likely dominates, and firms will spend more of the revenue hiring and attracting good workers for the firm. The marginal product revenue of workers is likely to increase, which is likely to shift the existing labor demand curve to the right

6c. This will likely lead to a decrease in demand for labor, or in other words, a movement along the existing labor demand curve. 

**Marginal Revenue Product: (MRP)**
- The marginal revenue that is created for the utilization of one additional unit of resources.

The scale effect dominated, since we see that, as banks produce more and more (become more and more efficient), they were able to hire more at the same time. In terms of the impact on labor, the scale effect dominated because the increase in productivity of the banks led to more laboureres being hired, as the banks sought to expand the services it can provide to its users. This would mean that, on net, labour and capital will be considered complements in the industry.

The study provided tells us that the best chief executives can increase the value of a company by around 0.016% compared to a lesser alternative. Assuming Phebe Novakovic is one of the best of the best, we see that the extra value she generates over other employees is around:
$0.016\times 47\times 10^9 / 100 = 7.52$ million

So since $20.7$ million is greater than $7.52$ million, it appears as if Phebe Novakovic is overpaid. Instead of the massive $20.7$ million, she should be paid $7.52$ million.

8a. Women having more education than men in the industry suggests that women likely have a higher marginal product revenue than men, meaning they are able to produce a greater increase in revenue for companies and are likely more productive. This would justify a higher pay for women, however since that is not the case, this could provide evidence for discrimination.
8b. This does not justify anything, but instead suggests that women in the industry should have roughly the same productivity as their male counterparts. 
8c. This suggests that men are better at dealing with stressful jobs than women, and this justifies a compensating differential, as some jobs are not as pleasant as others and more pay is required to motivate people to do said jobs.

9a. This is a fair outcome under the notion of equal outcomes. The parent clearly believes that each children deserves the same amount of lemonade (equality of outcomes), hence motivating students to fill their glasses only up to a certain level.
9b. This is a fair outcome under the notion of equal opportunity. Student clearly believes that the distribution of finite resources(such as lemonade) should be based on equality of opportunity, rather than of outcome.
9c. By the standards of the utillitarian, my goal will be to ensure maximal well-being of everyone

The political philosophy that government should try to maximize total utility in society is known as utilitarianism. This belief holds that government redistribution is beneficial because transferring $100 from someone with a lot of resources—like Michael Jordan—to someone with fewer resources—like Alison Stine—will lead to a society with a higher level of well-being, or utility. That gain arises because taxing $100 of Michael Jordan’s income reduces his utility by only a little compared to the utility gain that Alison Stine would enjoy from receiving that $100. As such, government can raise total utility by redistributing resources from the rich to the poor.

Since the **20,000-25,000** dollars being redistributed lowers the well being of the people in the **100,000** dollar earning bracket by much more than it otherwise would for people earning a wage of up to **200,000**, as people with earnings of 100K are half as rich as people with earnings of 200k, and therefore the **25,000** dollars means twice as much to them. Furthermore, this also leads to a very great effective tax rate for people earning within the **50,000s**, since their effecive income (after taxes) will not rise at all, even if they entirely double the level of their income. Similarly, for the wealthier party, this form of income reduction disincentivises the wealthier party from working.

5a. Decrease in unemployment rate
5b. Underemployment → However, this is not factored into unemployment rate calculations
5c. Decrease in unemployment rate(larger work force)
5d. Increase in unemployment rate(larger work force and larger unemployment)

![[chrome_1OITY60diS.png]]
9a. 10 dollars per hour
9b. None, so there is no unemployment 
9c. There is 4000 workers who are employed at $11 per hour. THere is unemployment of over 8000 workers as 4000 want to work but can't. The workers here are thereby structurally unemployed, as they are unemployed because of a mismatch of skills and labour market demand, or in this case, a government regulation.

13,800* 251.1/53.8 = $64,408

![[chrome_W3ctfPiEfu.png]]
8a. Nominal growth rate = (267-183)/183 = 45.9%
8b. We see apple's revenue in 2014 dollars would be:
	$236.7/251.1 \times 267 = 251.688$ 
8c. Real growth rate = (251.688-183)/183 = 37.53%

The real interest rate they expected to earn from your loan is 2%. If inflation is actually 5% each year, then that means the bank earned a real interest rate of 0%. In such a case, the borrower(the student) is better off if inflation is higher than expected, since they do not have to return as much monetary assets. If lower than expected, then the real interst rate is higher than 2%, so the banks benefit more than expected.

3a. The output gap would decrease from 5% to 0%, as people are less incentivised to spend and aggregate demand falls. This will pull down the real GDP output and therefore will decrease the output gap.
3b. As there is an increase in real interest rate, the cost of borrowing increased, as members of the economy: consumers, firms and the government, now must pay a higher real cost of borrowing. This will reduce their incentive to spend, thus decreasing aggregate expenditure. This is represented as the movement along the IS curve, which is the investment savings curve. 

3c. Potential output is unaffected as that is determined by the quality and quantity of factors of productions. However, actual output decreases as less people are spending.

a. done
b. The risk premium is equal to $1.5 - (4-3)$ which is equal to $0.5$. 
c. MP curve will shift upwards if the risk premium increased.

![[chrome_vhvcxFQx4O.png]]
a. Multiplier = 6/2 = 300% = 3
b. ![[chrome_heVTLOQV0Z.png]]
c. It should pull back on government spending as it should attempt to push the economy to the level at which the output gap is zero. That is the highest sustainable level of output that the economy can produce. In this case (assuming interest rates unchanged), the IS curve will shift to the level at which it intersects with the MP curve at exactly 0% output gap. 


# Spending Shocks Shift the IS Curve
**Spending shock one: Consumption increases when people feel more prosperous.**

<u>Wealth:</u> When the stock market booms, or house prices rise, stockholders and homeowners feel more prosperous because their wealth has increased. As those lucky stockholders and homeowners spend some of their newfound wealth, consumption will increase.

<u>Consumer confidence:</u> The interdependence principle reminds you that the decisions you make today depend on your expectations about what’s going to happen in the future. And when you feel confident that your income will grow in the future, you might ramp up your spending in advance. As a result, consumption increases when an improved economic outlook boosts consumer confidence.

<u>Taxes and government assistance: </u> When the government cuts taxes, or when it increases government assistance payments like unemployment insurance, people have more disposable income that they can use to buy stuff. And so consumption increases when government policy puts more money in people’s pockets.

<u>Inequality:</u> People with low incomes tend to spend a larger share of their income than do those with higher incomes. It follows that redistributing income from those with higher incomes to those with lower incomes—including through government transfer payments and changes in the tax system—tends to increase consumption.

**Spending shock two: Investment increases when it’s profitable for businesses to expand.**

<u>An expanding economy: </u>When the economy is expanding, so is the demand for your products. In order to produce more, managers need to expand their production capacity. As a result, investment in new equipment increases when the economy is expanding more rapidly.

<u>Business confidence:</u> Because capital investments tend to last for years, or even decades, your assessments about whether to buy new equipment should depend not only on today’s profits, but also on your expectations about future profitability. That’s why investment increases when managers are more confident about their long-term profitability.

<u>Corporate taxes:</u> Lower corporate taxes increase the after-tax profits that entrepreneurs earn from investing in new equipment. As a result, investment falls in response to higher corporate taxes. Conversely, investment rises in response to targeted investment tax credits that reduce the after-tax cost of buying new equipment.

<u>Lending standards and cash reserves:</u> If your business finds it hard to borrow money at a reasonable interest rate, your best alternative is to invest in new equipment only when your company has the cash on hand to do so. It follows that investment tends to increase when loans are easier to get, or businesses have large cash reserves. Cash reserves are particularly important when the financial system is not working well.

<u>Uncertainty: </u>If you’re uncertain about the economic outlook—it could be great, it could be terrible—remember that you usually have the option to postpone breaking ground on major investment projects until the outlook is a bit clearer. Lower uncertainty leads managers to restart these shelved projects, leading to an increase in investment.

**Spending shock three: Government purchases increase when fiscal policy seeks to expand the economy.**

**Spending shock four: Government purchases increase when fiscal policy seeks to expand the economy.**

**Financial Shock:**
Any change in borrowing conditions that changes the real interest rate at which people can borrow. Financial shocks shift the MP curve.

<u>Examples of Financial Shock:</u>
- **Financial shock one: Changes in monetary policy.**
- **Financial shock two: Financial market risks shift the risk premium.**
	- <u>Default risk: </u>When there’s an increased risk that borrowers will default—that they won’t repay their debts or won’t repay in a timely fashion—lenders demand a larger risk premium, which leads the MP curve to shift upward.
	- <u>Liquidity risk:</u> When banks need cash—that is, liquidity—they can usually get it by selling some of their loans to other lenders. Liquidity risk arises when disruptions in financial markets mean that there aren’t any buyers, or there aren’t any willing to pay a reasonable price. A rise in liquidity risk increases the risk premium, which shifts the MP curve upward.
	- <u>Interest rate risk:</u> Lending someone money at a fixed interest rate for a long time, as in a 30-year mortgage, raises another risk: The long-term interest rate you offer today might turn out to be a bad deal if future interest rates or inflation are unexpectedly higher. And so increasing uncertainty about future interest rates or inflation raises interest rate risk, which increases the risk premium, shifting the MP curve up.
	- <u>Risk aversion:</u> When lenders become more reluctant to take on risk—that is, when they become more risk averse—they’ll only be willing to make a loan if they can charge a higher risk premium. Thus, swings in market sentiment that make lenders more risk averse will shift the MP curve up.
**Risk free rate** rises in response to monetary policy
**Risk premium** rises in response to macroeconomic conditions, or if lending itself becomes riskier.

8a. Financial shock, as this will lead to much more spending by members of the economy. Lenders will lend more money and more of the money will be defaulted, leaving lenders (and the society as a whole) with less financial assets. This leads the MP curve to fall as interest rates decrease and the output gap will in turn become more positive. 
8b. This will shift the IS curve to the left as there is now less government spending, and thus a spending shock results and there will be less spending at every interest rate.
8c. This leads to a great spending shock as corporations are now able to spend more of the money otherwise paid as tax, which will increase consumption.
8d. Financial shock, as high interest rates expectations will lead to less lenders willing to lend in anticipation of the high interest rates, which will lead to a self-sustaining prophecy of interest rates increasing, thus shifting the MP curve.
8e. Spending shock. As electricity becomes more abundant, people's livelihoods become better, and naturally so does their income. With higher income, people are inclined to spend more. Electric power providers are also inclined to spend more.
