**What is the equilibrium unemployment rate and why isn’t it equal to zero?**  
The equilibrium unemployment rate is the equilibrium rate at which workers are unemployed, assuming that the overall economy is producing at full employment output. 

This rate is not equal to zero due to the existence of structural and frictional unemployment within every economy. Structural unemployment is the unemployment that is a direct result of a mismatch between skills of certain workers and skills demanded in the market. In short, some workers do not have the skills that are demanded by the market, and therefore are unemployed. Frictional unemployment is the unemployment that is a direct result of workers who are in between jobs or who have left the job market to develop their skills. For example, college students studying to become more productive, or someone who is looking for a job that more suits their abilities. As seen below, even when the economy is producing at the full-employment / potential output, there is still some level of unemployment, and this is why the equilibrium unemployment rate cannot be zero. 


**What is it called when a company pays its employees a wage greater than the prevailing market real wage?**  
It is called **efficiency wages**, and it is done by companies, firms and individuals so as to incentivise the workers being hired to more proactively work. This is done often when supervision of the labour is rather impractical, or otherwise when the labour task being performed has importance to the buyer of labor, such as nannys taking care of children. Such higher than market real wages are often paid to incentivise loyalty, increased productivity and efficnecy in workers. 

**What is the impact of these efficiency wages on unemployment and on the overall labor market?**
The greater efficiency wages offered by buyers of labour leads to greater quantity supplied of such labor, as more people are willing to supply their labour at higher than real wage rate.  As a result, this can increase unemployment. In fact, this may offer a reason as to why the overall labour market is never fully employed… since certain industries are bound to be controlled by efficiency wages, which would lead to an imbalance of labour supply and labour demand, thus unemployment. 

**How is macroeconomic equilibrium related to equilibrium GDP? How does equilibrium GDP differ from potential GDP?**
Macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when the economy is producing at the point of full-employment output, where the maximum possible output is produced by the economy given the available resources. At this point, we have that the short-run aggregate demand intersects with the aggregate supply, meaning that the macroeconomic equilibrium outputs at the equilbrium GDP. The equillibrium GDP is the real GDP that is produced by an economy at equilbrium, where the short-run aggregate demand intersects with the short-run aggregate supply. Since the short-run aggregate demand and supply are prone to influences from the outside world, such as sudden changes in consumer spending due to increased confidence within the economy, we see that sometimes the equilibrium GDP may produce at a level that is higher than, or lower than the potential GDP. 

**Explain how prolonged recessions can occur and how an economy can become stuck in a bad equilibrium even if both buyers and sellers are making the best decisions they can. How  
can the economy become unstuck?**

Prolonged recessions can occur when aggregate demand is persistently low over a long period. This can be a result of persistent low confidence in the economy. Usually, when governements attempt to increase economic output, they do so by increasing spending. They increase their own spending using the fiscal budget, and they then seek to increase spending by consumers and businesses through lowered interest rates, incentivising consuemrs and businesses to borrow and spend. However, sometimes consumers and businesses are unwilling to spend even if interest rates are at zero. Interest rates cannot be lowered below zero, since otherwise the banks will not have any revenue, as no one would leave financial assets in the banks. In such cases, the economy may be stuck in a situation of producing at a much lower level of output than the equilibrium level, as available resources within the economy cannot be utilised due to persistently low demand. 

**What are the three inflationary forces we’ve discussed in class?  

1. Inflationary expectations 
When consumers and businesses believe that the future level of inflation is going to be high, they are incentivised to spend. This, in turn, pushes up prices, and provides upwards inflationary pressure. For example, when people in, say, Venezuela, expect high inflation in the future, they will rush to purchase  as much as they can using the cash assets they have on hand, as they expect their cash assets to lose value very quickly. 

3. Demand-pull inflation
When aggregate demand increases, price levels go up, and therefore inflation occurs. For example, aggregate demand increasing can be seen when more and more people are able to buy more expensive good, such as luxury products. When more people buy such products, luxury shops may get crowded, and luxury shop owners may not have the available resources to service everyone. As a result, they will raise their prices to disincentivse a certain amount of people from purchasing the products. 

5. Cost-push inflation / Supply Shocks
When aggregate supply decreases due to increased costs of production for firms, the potential output decreases. Once this happenes, then price levels go up. 

**Give an example of how each might affect prices.  
What is unexpected inflation and how does this relate to these inflationary forces?** 
Unexpected inflation is, quite simply, the difference between the actual real rate of inflation and inflation expectations. When unexpected inflation is positive(there is more inflation than that is expected), then there will be a larger output gap, as excess spending will lead to a greater real output. 

When unexpected inflation is negative(i.e, when real otuput is less than expected output), then there will be a negative output gap, as less spending will lead to less real output. 

**Unexpected Inflation** = inflation - Inflation expectations

**Why do we say that expectations about future inflation act as a “self-fulfilling prophecy”? How can this be avoided?**
When members of an economy expect inflation to be high or low, then they will adjust their spendings to the appropriate levels. 

**What policies can the government enact in order to mitigate this?**
Counteract the inflationary spiral by raising interest rates more
Counteract the deflationary spiral by spending huge fiscal budgets.

**What forces lead to movement along the Phillips curve? What forces cause the Phillips curve to shift up or down?**
Change in output gap causes movement along Philips curve. This change in output gap is determined by the forces of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and where they intersect. If they intersect at an output point that is greater than the full-employment / potential GDP, then the result is greater output at a greater

**Shift the Philips Curve**
- Supply shocks(*unanticipated* changes to input costs and costs of production) shift the philips curve, as they cause changes to inflation at every output gap. When costs of production and input costs rise *unexpectedly*, then real inflation rises at every possible output gap. Similarly, if costs of production suddenly decline, real inflation will also decrease.
- Productivity shift philips curve. A sudden (*unexpected*) increase in productivity decreases costs rapidly and therefore leads to decreasing price levels, hence a lower inflation rate. 
- Exchange rates. When dollar depreciates, foreign goods become expensive. This increases the cost of foreign goods and therefore increases inflation

Philips curve movement:
- Depends on AD and AS, and depends on the output gap
Philips curve shift:
- Depends on supply shocks, productivity and exchange rates. SEP

**Philip Curve**
![[Pasted image 20221213102858.png]]
It is a straight line plotted between unexpected inflation and output gap. When there is excess demand, then the economy will be overheating and producing at an output that is greater than the potential GDP. This will lead to businesses and producers raising prices as a means to partition scarce factors of production, which is currently being overused as there is too much demand. As a result, price levels, hence inflation will increase, thus increasing unexpected inflation. 

**Describe Okun’s Law/Rule of Thumb and explain how this allows us to derive the labor market Phillip’s Curve?**
Okun's Law/Rule of thumb tells us about the relationship between an output gap and the unemployment rate. The general rule of thumb stated by economist Okun is that a 1% increase in the unemployment rate will usually correspond to a 2% decrease in the GDP output. This allows us to draw the labour market philips curve, which has the real economic output gap as the x-axis, and the unemployment rate in the y-axis. The graph would look something like this:

**Where is there equilibrium in the AD-AS framework?**  
Equilibrium in the AD-AS framework occurs at the point when the AD curve intersects with the AS curve, where the aggregate demand curve intersects with aggregate supply. As price levels increase, the economy will demand less output, but businesses and firms will be willing to produce more output. As a result, the AD and AS curves slope in opposite directions, and the equilibrium is the point of intersection between the two curves.

**How does aggregate demand (AD) relate to aggregate expenditure? How does it relate to GDP/output? How does it relate to the prevailing price level in the economy?**  
1. Aggregate demand shows the total aggregate expenditure at different price levels of an economy
2. Aggregate demand shows the GDP/output at different price levels of the economy
3. The prevailing price level of the economy is determined by the intersection point between aggregate demand and aggregate supply within an economy. 

**What leads to movement along the AD curve? What leads to a  shift of the AD curve itself?**
A movemnet along the AD curve occurs when the price levels change, which will in turn lead to a change in the total economic output demanded. A shift of the AD curve itself will result from a number of external factors unrelated to the price level, such as the consumer and producer confidence, the total income of consumers, the exchange rate and interest rates, and more. 

**If the Fed changes interest rates, how does this affect the AD  curve?**
Changing interest rates change the incentive to borrow, and thereby spend, for small businesses and individual consumers. An increase in interest rate decreases the incentive to borrow and thereby spend, which will shift AD to the left. Similarly, a decrease in interest rate increases incentive to borrow and spend, shifting AD to the right.

**What is monetary policy? Who gets to determine monetary policy? In the United States, what are the primary objectives of monetary policy?**  
Monetary policy is policy used by the federal bank to influence and manipulate the economy, usually via manipulating interest rates. This is done by the Federal Bank mainly through controlling the rates at which banks lend and borrow.

The central bank is responsible for monetary policy, which, in the U.S, the responsibility falls on the shoulder of the Federal Reseerve. The primary objective of monetary policy is to ensure a steady inflation rate, promote maximum employment and achieve stable prices in the long run. 

**What is the Federal Funds Rate? Is it something that can actually be set by a particular actor?**
The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other. This rate is not exactly influenced by any one person, but instead is influenced by the forces of supply and demand on the market for such loanable funds. However, the FED often attempts to influence it through various means.
1) Paying interest on banks for excess reserves. 
	1) Sets a sort of minimum for the federal funds rate
2) Borrowing overnnight to increase federal funds rate by the laws of demand and supply
	1) FED Borrows a lot of money, thereby raising federal funds rate 
3) Directly lend to banks
	1) Sets a cap(maximum for the federal funds rate)
4) Fed buys and sells government bonds.
	1) Increases and decreases the money supply

Federal funds rate = nominal interest rate (controlled by fed through various means)
![[chrome_AqB8J8cqCl.png]]

**FOMC** - Federal Open Market Committee

**What are the main monetary policy instruments the Fed has to change interest rates when the nominal rate is above 0%?**
- Changing the federal funds rate by influencing the rate at which the private banks can borrow from each other in the federal funds market. This is done thorugh setting effective upper caps and lower caps by allowing banks to borrow at certain rates(thereby setting a cap) and paying interest on excess reserves(thereby setting a base)

**How can the Federal Reserve influence long-term interest rates,  and shift the MP curve, without changing the current risk-free interest rate?**


**Risk-free interest rates**: The interest rate at which government sells its debt. 
**Risk Premium**: The extra percentage in interest rate that is being charged

(REAL INTEREST RATE)
Federal Funds Rate - Inflation rate 

= Neutral Real Interest Rate 
(GOOD REAL INTEREST RATE)
+1/2(Inflation-2%) + Output Gap

The fed will raise the federal funds rate by a factor of 2.9%.


**What does it mean to implement *countercyclical* fiscal policy?**
Countercyclical fiscal policy is fiscal policy that aims to influence the economy in the direction that opposeses the cyclical cycle. When the economy is producing at the peak output, where real output is greater than potential output, contercyclical fiscal policy seeks to act against the change in real GDP and decrease it to levels of the potential output. Similarly, during a recessionary phase of the businesss cycle, countercyclical policy seeks to increase economic output so as to counteract the recessionary gap.  

**When is fiscal policy particularly effective/necessary?**
Fiscal policy is particularly necessary when the economy is in a deep recession, when monetary policy is insufficient to boost demand. In the situation of a deep recession, there exists very low aggregate demand, and as a result large quantities of unutilised resources. Fiscal policy, when used in a deep recession through transfer payments and government purchases, will cause increases in the real GDP as defined by the multiplier. Unlike as usual, fiscal policy will not lead to inflation (due to the very low spending and large capacity of unused resources), nor will it lead to crowding out of the private sector, since there is very little demand for loanable funds. 

**Describe how automatic stabilizers respond when output is above  potential output. Assess the extent to which these responses are timely, targeted, and temporary.**
Automatic stabilisers will naturally respond to stabilise the economy when the economy is producing above potential output. When the economy produces higher than potential output, more people are employed and people's incomes are higher, which leads to more tax revenue and less government spending. Since governments get more revenue through taxes, less money is available to the general public and businesses to spend, which would add impetus to preventing aggregate demand from rising further(aggregating the inflationary spiral). Similarly, when the economy is in a recession, goverment tax revenues decrease as people's and businesses incomes decrease, while govenrment spending increases through mandated social welfare programs. Since these measures are implemented immediately after the economy changes and people's incomes change, it is very timely. Since these measures (reduced tax/ greater spending) only are implemented on people who'se incomes decreased, they are incredibly targeted. Since these measures are only implemented for the duration of the recession / boom, they are incredibly temporary. 

This leads to the three Ts of fiscal policy: It must be **timely, targeted, and temporary**. Timely refers to the idea that policy makers must act quickly, getting ahead of looming problems. Targeted refers to the idea that fiscal policy—unlike monetary policy—can focus on the specific regions, industries, and groups of workers who need the most help. Fiscal stimulus is more likely to be effective when it’s targeted in a way that gets money in the hands of those who are more likely to spend it. (By contrast, sending money to people who are going to save it or pay off existing debt won’t raise spending and hence won’t boost GDP.) Finally, temporary refers to the idea that extra spending is no longer required when the economy has recovered. Indeed, as we’re about to see, were a rise in government spending to persist, it risks reducing private investment.
