Today was ok. Kinda sad lowkey. Woke up at like 11 cuz I slept late last night. Then finished math homework. Then went to eat. Met some ppl. After that went back to suite to study(lowkey to procrastinate). Watched some tv essays about top gun and marvel cinematic universe(and how shit its becoming). Then I opened up my chinese flute and played it for the first time. Had a lot of fun doing that. Did that with Jason, a pre cool dude from Singapore here at UC berkeley. We hung out for like 3 hrs, playing flute and ping pong lol. Then I met with Prof Carlo Sequin's team, led some interesting discussions. Then I ate with Michael in foothill dining hall and watched some American football. San Fran(76ers) vs Denver(broncos). Was shit game, left early. Then sorta just roamed around not doing much. Studied the JIPCAD software ig. Thats it lol.
