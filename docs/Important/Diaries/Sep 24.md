Today was late start. Woke up at 11 lol Then went to lunch with Vincent, Dhriti and Bee and talked about some stuff I forgot about. Then the others left and I chatted with Bee about some studies and some other stuff. Then went to dorm, did math hmwk for 5 hrs. Still couldn't finish. Got too tired so I went to eat dinner. Met Robby and Yifei Nicholas and another dude, some cool Chinese ppl. They seem v social and going to drinking gathering tmr as part of CPU. V Chill. Then I played ping pong with Robby for 30 min, then got ready to go to STAR social. it was late, at 8pm, didn't wanna go myself, so I went with Eren an international. STAR party was fun, didn't drink at first, chatted to lots of new ppl. Then Nathan and my suitemate friends came after we had boba tgt cuz of Nathan's punishment. The girls (Bee and Dhrithi) left, and Nathan and I drank, chatted, and had lots of fun. Took pictures and got to k many hot girls. It was a chill day although not as eventful.
