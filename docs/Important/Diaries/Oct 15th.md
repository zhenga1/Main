Today was a pretty tiring day. Got up very late, from yesterday's late night grind for the rocket club. I met with a new chinese girl at super duper burger who recommended me to this hiking/outdoors club, which was pretty cool. Then I finished CS project completely. When I came back, I brushed through JIPCAD meeting, had a nice discussion, but then was struggling to understand EECS notes. I then ate dinner with Jinwoo and had a nice convo. Then I did EECS homework. It was pretty chill
