Hey everyone, my name is Aaron Zheng and I'm just your average kid from Hong Kong. I studied in RCHK(renaissance college hong kong) since I was 9, and now I study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. 

In my spare time, I like to play guitar and chinese flute. I also especially like to skateboard

Welcome to my blogs and my notes, and hope to get to know you.
